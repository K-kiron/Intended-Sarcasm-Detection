0,There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!
1,"C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!"
2,So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?
3,"Wait, does he eat chalk?"
4,"Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!"
5,"Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and- not having sex."
6,Sounds like a date to me.
7,"Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realise I am totally naked."
8,"Oh, yeah. Had that dream."
9,"Then I look down, and I realise there's a phone... there."
10,Instead of...?
11,That's right.
12,Never had that dream.
13,No.
14,"All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. And it turns out it's my mother, which is very weird, because- she never calls me!"
15,Hi.
16,"This guy says hello, I wanna k*ll myself."
17,"Are you okay, sweetie?"
18,"I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck..."
19,Cookie?
20,Carol moved her stuff out today.  Let me get you some coffee.
21,Ooh! Oh! 
22,"No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay? I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy."
23,No you don't.
24,"No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!"
25,And you never knew she was a lesbian...
26,"No!! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?"
27,Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian...  Did I say that out loud?
28,"Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?"
29,"Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!"
30,"I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just- I just wanna be married again!"
31,And I just want a million dollars! 
32,Rachel?!
33,"Oh God Monica hi! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!"
34,Can I get you some coffee?
35,"De-caff.  Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor.  This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and- you remember my brother Ross? "
36,"Hi, sure!"
37,Hi. 
38,"So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?"
39,"Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realised that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, he always looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.  So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city."
40,Who wasn't invited to the wedding.
41,"Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue..."
42,"Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it. "
43,"Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me! "
44,"Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants."
45,I say push her down the stairs.
46,Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! 
47,"C'mon Daddy, listen to me! All of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!"
48,You can see where he'd have trouble.
49,"Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica. "
50,"Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica..."
51,"Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait!! Wait, I said maybe!!"
52,"Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things..."
53,"Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, ..bluebells and sleighbells and- something with mittens... La la la la..."
54,I'm all better now.
55,I helped!
56,"Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life."
57,"And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot."
58,"Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!"
59,"What, like there's a rule or something?"
60,"Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound."
61,"It's, uh, it's Paul."
62,Buzz him in!
63,Who's Paul?
64,"Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?"
65,Maybe.
66,Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?
67,He finally asked you out?
68,Yes!
69,"Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment."
70,"Rach, wait, I can cancel..."
71,"Please, no, go, that'd be fine!"
72,"Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?"
73,That'd be good...
74,Really?
75,"No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!"
76,"Hi, come in! Paul, this is.. ... everybody, everybody, this is Paul."
77,Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!
78,"I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?"
79,Two seconds.
80,"Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good."
81,"So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?"
82,"Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!"
83,"Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your-  -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture."
84,"Yes, and we're very excited about it. "
85,"Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight.."
86,"Okay, sure."
87,"Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?"
88,"Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to."
89,"I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little whim guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and- I cannot feel my legs."
90,What's this?
91,I have no idea.
92,Done with the bookcase!
93,All finished!
94,"This was Carol's favourite beer. She always drank it out of the can, I should have known."
95,"Ross, let me ask you a question. She got the furniture, the stereo, the good TV- what did you get?"
96,You guys.
97,"Oh, man."
98,You got screwed.
99,Oh my God!
100,"I know, I know, I'm such an idiot. I guess I should have caught on when she started going to the dentist four and five times a week. I mean, how clean can teeth get?"
101,"My brother's going through that right now, he's such a mess. How did you get through it?"
102,"Well, you might try accidentally breaking something valuable of hers, say her-"
103,-leg?
104,"That's one way! Me, I- I went for the watch."
105,You actually broke her watch?
106,"Barry, I'm sorry... I am so sorry... I know you probably think that this is all about what I said the other day about you making love with your socks on, but it isn't... it isn't, it's about me, and I ju-  Hi, machine cut me off again... anyway..."
107,"You know what the scariest part is? What if there's only one woman for everybody, y'know? I mean what if you get one woman- and that's it? Unfortunately in my case, there was only one woman- for her..."
108,"What are you talking about? 'One woman'? That's like saying there's only one flavour of ice cream for you. Lemme tell you something, Ross. There's lots of flavours out there. There's Rocky Road, and Cookie Dough, and Bing! Cherry Vanilla. You could get 'em with Jimmies, or nuts, or whipped cream! This is the best thing that ever happened to you! You got married, you were, like, what, eight? Welcome back to the world! Grab a spoon!"
109,I honestly don't know if I'm hungry or horny.
110,Stay out of my freezer!
111,"Ever since she walked out on me, I, uh..."
112,"What?..... What, you wanna spell it out with noodles?"
113,"No, it's, it's more of a fifth date kinda revelation."
114,"Oh, so there is gonna be a fifth date?"
115,Isn't there?
116,"Yeah... yeah, I think there is. -What were you gonna say?"
117,"Well, ever-ev-... ever since she left me, um, I haven't been able to, uh, perform.  ...Sexually. "
118,"Oh God, oh God, I am sorry... I am so sorry..."
119,It's okay...
120,Being spit on is probably not what you need right now. Um... how long?
121,Two years.
122,Wow! I'm glad you smashed her watch! 
123,"So you still think you, um... might want that fifth date?"
124,"...Yeah. Yeah, I do."
125,"'I, Joanie, take you, Charles, to be my lawful husband.' 'Do you take...'"
126,Oh...see... but Joanie loved Chachi! That's the difference!
127,"Grab a spoon. Do you know how long it's been since I've grabbed a spoon? Do the words 'Billy, don't be a hero' mean anything to you? Y'know, here's the thing. Even if I could get it together enough to- to ask a woman out,... who am I gonna ask? "
128,"Isn't this amazing? I mean, I have never made coffee before in my entire life."
129,That is amazing.
130,"Congratulations. And while you're on a roll, if you feel like you gotta make like a Western omelette or something...  Although actually I'm really not that hungry..."
131,Morning. Good morning.
132,Morning.
133,"Morning, Paul."
134,"Hello, Paul."
135,"Hi, Paul, is it?"
136,I had a really great time last night.
137,Thank you. Thank you so much. 
138,We'll talk later.
139,Yeah.  Thank you. 
140,That wasn't a real date?! What the hell do you do on a real date?
141,"Shut up, and put my table back."
142,Okayyy! 
143,"All right, kids, I gotta get to work. If I don't input those numbers,... it doesn't make much of a difference... "
144,"So, like, you guys all have jobs?"
145,"Yeah, we all have jobs. See, that's how we buy stuff."
146,"Yeah, I'm an actor."
147,Wow! Would I have seen you in anything?
148,I doubt it. Mostly regional work.
149,"Oh wait, wait, unless you happened to catch the Reruns' production of Pinocchio."
150,"'Look, Gippetto, I'm a real live boy.'"
151,I will not take this abuse. 
152,"You're right, I'm sorry.  'Once I was a wooden boy, a little wooden boy..'"
153,So how you doing today? Did you sleep okay? Talk to Barry? I can't stop smiling.
154,I can see that. You look like you slept with a hanger in your mouth.
155,"I know, he's just so, so... Do you remember you and Tony DeMarco?"
156,"Oh, yeah."
157,"Well, it's like that. With feelings."
158,Oh wow. Are you in trouble.
159,"Okay. Okay. I am just going to get up, go to work and not think about him all day. Or else I'm just gonna get up and go to work."
160,"Oh, look, wish me luck!"
161,What for?
162,I'm gonna go get one of those job things.
163,"Hey, Monica!"
164,"Hey, welcome back! How was Florida?"
165,"You had sex, didn't you?"
166,How do you do that?
167,So? Who?
168,You know Paul?
169,"Paul the Wine Guy? Oh yeah, I know Paul."
170,You mean you know Paul like I know Paul?
171,"Are you kidding? I take credit for Paul. Y'know before me, there was no snap in his turtle for two years."
172,Of course it was a line!
173,"Why?! Why? Why, why would anybody do something like that?"
174,I assume we're looking for an answer more sophisticated than 'to get you into bed'.
175,Is it me? Is it like I have some sort of beacon that only dogs and men with severe emotional problems can hear?
176,"All right, c'mere, gimme your feet. "
177,"I just thought he was nice, y'know?"
178,I can't believe you didn't know it was a line!
179,Guess what?
180,You got a job?
181,Are you kidding? I'm trained for nothing! I was laughed out of twelve interviews today.
182,And yet you're surprisingly upbeat.
183,"You would be too if you found John and David boots on sale, fifty percent off!"
184,"Oh, how well you know me..."
185,"They're my new 'I don't need a job, I don't need my parents, I've got great boots' boots!"
186,How'd you pay for them?
187,"Uh, credit card."
188,And who pays for that?
189,Um... my... father.
190,"C'mon, you can't live off your parents your whole life."
191,I know that. That's why I was getting married.
192,"Give her a break, it's hard being on your own for the first time. "
193,Thank you.
194,"You're welcome. I remember when I first came to this city. I was fourteen. My mom had just k*lled herself and my step-dad was back in prison, and I got here, and I didn't know anybody. And I ended up living with this albino guy who was, like, cleaning windows outside port authority, and then he k*lled himself, and then I found aromatherapy. So believe me, I know exactly how you feel."
195,The word you're looking for is 'Anyway'...
196,You ready?
197,I don't think so.
198,"C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,..."
199,"Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut... "
200,Welcome to the real world! It sucks. You're gonna love it!
201,"Well, that's it. "
202,You gonna crash on the couch?
203,"No. No, I gotta go home sometime."
204,You be okay?
205,Yeah.
206,"Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor.  What?"
207,"That's Paul's watch. You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy. Alright. Goodnight, everybody. "
208,"Mmm.  Oh, no-"
209,Sorry-
210,"No no no, go-"
211,"No, you have it, really, I don't want it-"
212,Split it?
213,Okay.
214,"Okay.  You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um, major crush on you."
215,I knew.
216,You did! Oh.... I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
217,I did.
218,"Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here- but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?"
219,"Yeah, maybe..."
220,"Okay... okay, maybe I will..."
221,Goodnight.
223,"See ya.... Waitwait, what's with you?"
224,I just grabbed a spoon. 
225,I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
226,I can't believe what I'm hearing here...
227,What? I-I said you had a-
228,What I said...
229,Would you stop?
230,"Oh, was I doing it again?"
231,Would anybody like more coffee?
232,"Did you make it, or are you just serving it?"
233,I'm just serving it.
234,"Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee."
235,"Kids, new dream... I'm in Las Vegas. I'm Liza Minelli-"
236,"What you guys don't understand is, for us, kissing is as important as any part of it."
237,"Yeah, right!.......Y'serious?"
238,"Oh, yeah! "
239,Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
240,Absolutely.
241,"Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like an opening act, y'know? I mean it's like the stand-up comedian you have to sit through before Pink Floyd comes out."
242,"Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like the comedian, it's that-that... that's not why we bought the ticket."
243,"The problem is, though, after the concert's over, no matter how great the show was, you girls are always looking for the comedian again, y'know? I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic... basically just trying to stay awake."
244,"Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian. Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourself sitting at home, listening to that album alone."
245,....Are we still talking about sex?
246,"No, it's good, it is good, it's just that- mm- doesn't she seem a little angry?"
247,"Well, she has issues."
248,Does she.
249,"He's out banging other women over the head with a club, while she sits at home trying to get the mastodon smell out of the carpet!"
250,"Marsha, these are cave people. Okay? They have issues like 'Gee, that glacier's getting kinda close.' See?"
251,"Speaking of issues, isn't that your ex-wife?"
252,No. No.
253,"Yes, it is. Carol! Hi! "
254,"Okay, okay, yes, it is.  How about I'll, uh, catch up with you in the Ice Age."
255,So.
256,"You look great. I, uh... I hate that."
257,Sorry. You look good too.
258,"Ah, well, in here, anyone who... stands erect... So what's new? Still, uh..."
259,A lesbian?
260,"Well... you never know. How's, um.. how's the family?"
261,"Marty's still totally paranoid. Oh, and, uh-"
262,"Why- why are you here, Carol?"
263,I'm pregnant.
264,Pregnant?!
265,"Oh, I think this is the episode of Three's Company where there's some kind of misunderstanding."
266,Are you through with that?
267,"Yeah, sorry, the swallowing slowed me down."
268,Whose little ball of paper is this?!
269,"Oh, uh, that would be mine. See, I wrote a note to myself, and then I realised I didn't need it, so I balled it up and...  ...now I wish I was dead."
270,"She's already fluffed that pillow... Monica, you know, you've already fluffed that-  -but, it's fine!"
271,"Look , I'm sorry, guys, I just don't wanna give them any more amm*nit*on than they already have."
272,"Yes, and we all know how cruel a parent can be about the flatness of a child's pillow."
273,"Monica- Hi! Um, Monica, you're scaring me. I mean, you're like, you're like all chaotic and twirly. And not-not in a good way."
274,"Yeah, calm down. You don't see Ross getting all chaotic and twirly every time they come."
275,"That's because as far as my parents are concerned, Ross can do no wrong. Y'see, he's the Prince. Apparently they had some big ceremony before I was born. "
276,"Ew, ew, ew, ew ew ew ew ew!"
277,What? 
278,Ugly Naked Guy got a Thighmaster!
279,Eeaagh!
280,Has anybody seen my engagement ring?
281,"Yeah, it's beautiful."
282,"Oh God, oh God, oh God oh God oh God oh God.... "
283,"No, look, don't touch that!"
284,"Oh, like I wasn't dreading tomorrow enough, having to give it back to him... 'Hi Barry! Remember me? I'm the girl in the veil who stomped on your heart in front of your entire family!' Oh God and now I'm gonna have to return the ring, without the ring, which makes it so much harder..."
285,"Easy Rach, we'll find it.  Won't we!"
286,Oh! Yeah!
287,"Alright, when'd'ya have it on last?"
288,Doy! Probably right before she lost it!
289,You don't get a lot of 'doy' these days...
290,"I know I had it this morning, and I know I had it when I was in the kitchen with..."
291,...Dinah?
292,"Ohhhhh, don't be mad..."
293,You didn't.
294,"Oh, I am sorry..."
295,I gave you one job! 
296,"Oh, but look how straight those noodles are!"
297,"Now, Monica, you know that's not how you look for an engagement ring in a lasagne..."
298,I just... can't do it.
299,Boys? We're going in.
300,.....Hi.
301,Wow. That is not a happy hi.
302,Carol's pregnant. 
303,Ooh! I found it!
304,W-w-wh-... wha-... w-w-w-...
305,"Yeah. Do that for another two hours, you might be where I am right about now. "
306,"Kinda puts that whole pillow thing in perspective, huh, Mon?"
307,"Well now, how-how do you fit into this whole thing?"
308,"Well, Carol says she and Susan want me to be involved, but if I'm not comfortable with it, I don't have to be involved.. basically it's entirely up to me."
309,She is so great! I miss her.
310,What does she mean by 'involved'?
311,"I mean presumably, the biggest part of your job is done."
312,"Anyway, they want me to go down to this- sonogram thing with them tomorrow."
313,So what are you gonna do?
314,"I have no idea. No matter what I do, though, I'm still gonna be a father."
315,".....Well, this is still ruined, right?"
316,"Oh, Martha Ludwin's daughter is gonna call you.  Mmm! What's that curry taste?"
317,Curry.
318,Mmmm! 
319,"I- I think they're great! I, I really do. "
320,"Do you remember the Ludwins? The big one had a thing for you, didn't she?"
321,They all had a thing for him.
322,"Aw, Mom..."
323,"I'm sorry, why is this girl going to call me?"
324,"Oh, she just graduated, and she wants to be something in cooking, or food, or.... I don't know. Anyway, I told her you had a restaurant-"
325,"No Mom, I don't have a restaurant, I work in a restaurant."
326,"Well, they don't have to know that... "
327,"Ross, could you come and help me with the spaghetti, please?"
328,Yeah. 
329,"Oh, we're having spaghetti! That's.... easy."
330,"I know this is going to sound unbelievably selfish, but, were you planning on bringing up the whole baby/lesbian thing? Because I think it might take some of the heat off me."
331,"What that Rachel did to her life.... We ran into her parents at the club, they were not playing	very well."
332,I'm not gonna tell you what they spent on that wedding... but forty thousand dollars is a lot of money!
333,"Well, at least she had the chance to leave a man at the altar..."
334,What's that supposed to mean?
335,Nothing! It's an expression.
336,No it's not. 
337,"Don't listen to your mother. You're independent, and you always have been! Even when you were a kid... and you were chubby, and you had no friends, you were just fine! And you would read alone in your room, and your puzzles..."
338,"Look, there are people like Ross who need to sh**t for the stars, with his museum, and his papers getting published. Other people are satisfied with staying where they are- I'm telling you, these are the people who never get cancer. "
339,"...And I read about these women trying to have it all, and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seem to have that problem. "
340,"So, Ross, what's going on with you? Any stories?  No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?"
341,"Okay! Okay.  Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wondering what exactly happened between Carol and me, and, so, well, here's the deal. Carol's a lesbian. She's living with a woman named Susan. She's pregnant with my child, and she and Susan are going to raise the baby."
342,And you knew about this?!
343,"Your folks are really that bad, huh?"
344,"Well, y'know, these people are pros. They know what they're doing, they take their time, they get the job done."
345,"Boy, I know they say you can't change your parents,... boy, if you could-  -I'd want yours."
346,Must pee. 
347,"Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins."
348,You're twins?
349,"Yeah. We don't speak. She's like this high-powered, driven career type."
350,What does she do?
351,She's a waitress.
352,"All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now. "
353,"Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't have any of this."
354,"Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend, who... my parents actually preferred."
355,"The lights, please.. "
356,...How long was I in there?
357,I'm just cleaning up.
358,D'ya.. uh.. d'ya need any help?
359,"Uh.. okay, sure! Thanks! "
360,"Anyway.. um..  So, you- uh- you nervous about Barry tomorrow?"
361,Oh.. a little..
362,Mm-hmm..
363,A lot.
364,Mm.
365,"So, got any advice? Y'know, as someone who's recently been- dumped?"
366,"Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word 'dumped'. Chances are he's gonna be this, this broken shell of a man, y'know, so you should try not to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard. Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll give Barry back his ring, and you can go with Carol and Susan to the OB/GYN..."
367,"Oh, you've got Carol tomorrow.. When did it get so complicated?"
368,Got me.
369,Remember when we were in high school together?
371,"I mean, didn't you think you were just gonna meet somone, fall in love- and that'd be it?  ..Ross?"
372,"Yes, yes!"
373,"Oh! Man, I never thought I'd be here.. "
374,Me either... 
375,"Sorry I'm late, I was stuck at work. There was this big dinosaur.. thing.. anyway."
377,"Ross, you remember Susan."
378,How could I forget? 
379,Ross.
380,"Hello, Susan.  Good shake. Good shake. So, uh, we're just waiting for...?"
381,Dr. Oberman.
382,..Dr. Oberman. Okay. And is he-
383,She.
384,"-she, of course, she- uh- familiar with our.. special situation?"
385,"Yes, and she's very supportive."
386,"Okay, that's great.  No, I'm- Oh. "
387,Thanks.
388,"Quack, quack.."
389,Ross? That opens my cervix. 
390,Barry?
391,C'mon in. 
392,Are you sure?
393,"Yeah! It's fine, it's fine. Robbie's gonna be here for hours."
394,Huh?!
395,"So, how ya doin?"
396,I'm- uh- I'm okay... You look great! 
397,"Yeah, well.."
398,"Dr. Farber, Jason Greenstein's gagging."
399,Be right there.  Be back in a sec.
400,I dumped him.
402,"So, um- so how's this, uh, how's this gonna work? Y'know, with us? Y'know, when, like, important decisions have to be made?"
403,Give me a 'for instance'.
404,"Well, uh, uh, I don't know, okay, okay, how about with the, uh, with the baby's name?"
405,Marlon-
406,Marlon?!
407,"-if it's a boy, Minnie if it's a girl."
408,...As in Mouse?
409,As in my grandmother.
410,"Still, you- you say Minnie, you hear Mouse. Um, how about, um.. how about Julia?"
411,Julia..
412,We agreed on Minnie.
413,"'S'funny, um, uh, we agreed we'd spend the rest of our lives together. Things change, roll with the punches. I believe Julia's on the table..?"
414,Sorry about that. So. What have you been up to?
415,"Oh, not much. I-I got a job."
416,"Oh, that's great."
417,Why are- why are you so tanned?
418,"Oh, I, uh- I went to Aruba."
419,Oh no. You went on our honeymoon alone?
420,"No. I went with, uh.. Now, this may hurt."
421,Me?!
422,No!  I went with Mindy.
423,"Mindy?! My maid of honour, Mindy?!"
424,"Yeah, well, uh, we're kind of a thing now. "
425,"Oh! Well, um..  You've got plugs!"
426,Careful! They haven't quite taken yet.
427,And you've got lenses! But you hate sticking your finger in your eye!
428,"Not for her. Listen, I really wanted to thank you."
429,Okay..
430,"See, about a month ago, I wanted to hurt you. More than I've ever wanted to hurt anyone in my life. And I'm an orthodontist. "
431,Wow.
432,"You know, you were right? I mean, I thought we were happy. We weren't happy. But with Mindy, now I'm happy. Spit."
433,What?
434,Me. 
435,"Anyway, um,  I guess this belongs to you. And thank you for giving it to me. "
436,"Well, thank you for giving it back."
437,Hello?!
438,"Oh, please! What's wrong with Helen?"
439,Helen Geller? I don't think so.
440,Hello? It's not gonna be Helen Geller.
441,Thank you!
442,"No, I mean it's not Geller."
443,"What, it's gonna be Helen Willick?"
444,"No, actually, um, we talked about Helen Willick-Bunch."
445,"Well, wait a minute, wha- why is she in the title?"
446,It's my baby too.
447,"Oh, 's'funny, really? Um, I don't remember you making any sperm."
448,"Yeah, and we all know what a challenge that is!"
449,"All right, you two, stop it!"
450,"No no no, she gets a credit, hey, I'm in there too. "
451,Ross. You're not actually suggesting Helen Willick-Bunch-Geller? 'Cause I think that borders on child abuse.
452,"Of course not, I'm... suggesting Geller-Willick-Bunch."
453,"Oh, no, nonononono, you see what he's doing? He knows no-one's gonna say all those names, so they'll wind up calling her Geller, then he gets his way!"
454,"My way?! You-you think this is my way? Believe me, of all the ways I ever imagined this moment in my life being, this is not my way- y'know what? Uh, um, this is too hard. I'm not, I can't do-"
455,Knock knock!How are we today? Any nausea?
456,Yeah. Yeah. A little.
457,"Well, I was just wondering about the mother-to-be, but.. thanks for sharing.  Uh, lie back.."
458,"You- uh- y'know what, I'm gonna go. I don't- I don't think I can be involved in this particular thing right now. "
459,Oh my God. 
460,Look at that.
461,I know. 
462,Well? Isn't that amazing?
463,What are we supposed to be seeing here?
464,"I dunno, but.. I think it's about to att*ck the Enterprise."
465,"You know, if you tilt your head to the left, and relax your eyes, it kinda looks like an old potato."
466,"Then don't do that, alright?"
467,Okay!
468,Monica. Whaddya think?
469,Mm-hmm.
470,Wh- are you welling up?
472,"You are, you're welling up."
473,Am not!
474,You're gonna be an aunt.
475,Oh shut up!
476,"Hi, Mindy. Hi, it-it's Rachel. Yeah, I'm fine. I-I saw Barry today. Oh, yeah, yeah he-he told me. No, no, it's okay. I hope you two are very happy, I really do. Oh, oh, and Mind, y'know, if-if everything works out, and you guys end up getting married and having kids- and everything- I just hope they have his old hairline and your old nose.   Okay, I know it was a cheap sh*t, but I feel SO much better now."
477,Hi guys!
478,"Hey, Pheebs! Hi!"
479,"Hey. Oh, oh, how'd it go? "
480,"Um, not so good. He walked me to the subway and said 'We should do this again!'"
481,Ohh. Ouch.
482,"What? He said 'we should do it again', that's good, right?"
483,"Uh, no. Loosely translated 'We should do this again' means 'You will never see me naked'. "
484,Since when?
485,"Since always. It's like dating language. Y'know, like 'It's not you' means 'It is you'."
486,Or 'You're such a nice guy' means 'I'm gonna be dating leather-wearing alcoholics and complaining about them to you'. 
487,"Or, or, y'know, um, 'I think we should see other people' means 'Ha, ha, I already am'."
488,And everybody knows this?
489,Yeah. Cushions the blow.
490,"Yeah, it's like when you're a kid, and your parents put your dog to sleep, and they tell you it went off to live on some farm."
491,"That's funny, that, no, because, uh, our parents actually did, uh, send our dog off to live on a farm."
492,"Uh, Ross."
493,"What? Wh- hello? The Millners' farm in Connecticut? The Millners, they had this unbelievable farm, they had horses, and, and rabbits that he could chase and it was- it w- .....Oh my God, Chi Chi!"
494,"""So how does it feel knowing you're about to die?"""
495,"""Warden, in five minutes my pain will be over. But you'll have to live with the knowledge that you sent an honest man to die."""
496,"Hey, that was really good! "
497,Thanks! Let's keep going.
498,"Okay. ""So. Whaddya want from me, Damone, huh?"""
499,"""I just wanna go back to my cell. 'Cause in my cell, I can smoke."""
500,"""Smoke away."""
501,I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone.
503,Relax your hand!
504,Not so much!
505,Whoah!
506,Hey!
508,"Alright, now try taking a puff."
509,Alright.. okay. No. Give it to me.
510,"No no no, I am not giving you a cigarette."
511,"It's fine, it's fine. Look, do you wanna get this part, or not? Here."
512,"Don't think of it as a cigarette. Think of it as the thing that's been missing from your hand. When you're holding it, you feel right. You feel complete."
513,Y'miss it?
514,"Nah, not so much. Alright, now we smoke.  Oh.. my.. God. "
515,"No, no, no. They say it's the same as the distance from the tip of a guy's thumb to the tip of his index finger."
516,That's ridiculous!
517,Can I use.. either thumb?
518,"Alright, don't tell me, don't tell me!  Decaf cappucino for Joey.. Coffee black.. Late.. And an iced tea. I'm getting pretty good at this!"
519,"Yeah. Yeah, excellent."
520,Good for me!
521,"Y'okay, Phoebe?"
522,"Yeah- no- I'm just- it's, I haven't worked- It's my bank."
523,What did they do to you?
524,"It's nothing, it's just- Okay. I'm going through my mail, and I open up their monthly, you know, STATEMENT-"
525,Easy.
526,- and there's five hundred extra dollars in my account.
527,"Oh, Satan's minions at work again..."
528,"Yes, 'cause now I have to go down there, and deal with them."
529,What are you talking about? Keep it!
530,"It's not mine, I didn't earn it, if I kept it, it would be like stealing."
531,"Yeah, but if you spent it, it would be like shopping!"
532,"Okay. Okay, let's say I bought a really great pair of shoes. Do you know what I'd hear, with every step I took? 'Not-mine. Not-mine. Not-mine.' And even if I was happy, okay, and, and skipping- 'Not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine, not-not-mine'..."
533,We're with you. We got it.
534,Okay. I'd- just- I'd never be able to enjoy it. It would be like this giant karmic debt.
535,"Chandler, what are you doing?"
536,Hey. Whaddya doing?
537,"Oh! Oh, God!"
538,What is this?!
539,"I'm smoking. I'm smoking, I'm smoking."
540,"Oh, I can't believe you! You've been so good, for three years!"
541,And this- is my reward!
542,"Hold on a second, alright? Just think about what you went through the last time you quit."
543,"Okay, so this time I won't quit!"
544,Ohhh! Put it out!
545,"All right! I'm putting it out, I'm putting it out. "
546,"Oh, no! I- I can't drink this now!"
547,"Alright. I'm gonna go change, I've got a date."
548,This Alan again? How's it goin'?
549,"'S'going pretty good, y'know? It's nice, and, we're having fun."
550,So when do we get to meet the guy?
551,"Let's see, today's Monday... Never."
552,"Oh, come on! Come on!"
553,No. Not after what happened with Steve.
554,What are you talking about? We love Schhteve! Schhteve was schhexy!.. Sorry.
555,"Look, I don't even know how I feel about him yet. Just give me a chance to figure that out."
556,"Well, then can we meet him?"
557,Nope. Schhorry.
558,"I mean, why should I let them meet him? I mean, I bring a guy home, and within five minutes they're all over him. I mean, they're like- coyotes, picking off the weak members of the herd."
559,"Listen. As someone who's seen more than her fair share of bad beef, I'll tell you: that is not such a terrible thing. I mean, they're your friends, they're just looking out after you."
560,"I know. I just wish that once, I'd bring a guy home that they actually liked."
561,"Well, you do realise the odds of that happening are a little slimmer if they never get to meet the guy.."
562,"Let it go, Ross. "
563,"Yeah, well, you didn't know Chi Chi."
564,Do you all promise?
565,Yeah! We promise! We'll be good!
566,Chandler? Do you promise to be good?
567,"You can come in, but your filter-tipped little buddy has to stay outside!"
568,"Hey, Pheebs."
569,"'Dear Ms. Buffay. Thank you for calling attention to our error. We have credited your account with five hundred dollars. We're sorry for the inconvenience, and hope you'll accept this-  -football phone as our free gift.' Do you believe this?! Now I have a thousand dollars, and a football phone! "
570,What bank is this?
571,Hey. It's him.  Who is it?
572,It's Alan.
573,Chandler! He's here!
574,"Okay, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like me."
575,"Hi. Alan, this is everybody. Everybody, this is Alan."
577,"Hi, Alan."
578,I've heard schho much about all you guyschh!
579,"Thanks. I'll call you tomorrow.  Okay. Okay, let's let the Alan-bashing begin. Who's gonna take the first sh*t, hmm?"
580,C'mon!
581,"...I'll go. Let's start with the way he kept picking at- no, I'm sorry, I can't do this, can't do this. We loved him."
582,Loved him! Yeah! He's great!
583,Wait a minute! We're talking about someone that I'm going out with?
584,Yeah! 
585,And did you notice...? 
587,Know what was great? The way his smile was kinda crooked.
588,"Yes, yes! Like the man in the shoe!"
589,...What shoe?
590,"From the nursery rhyme. 'There was a crooked man, Who had a crooked smile, Who lived in a shoe, For a... while...'"
591,...So I think Alan will become the yardstick against which all future boyfriends will be measured.
592,"What future boyfriends? Nono, I th- I think this could be, y'know, it."
593,Really!
594,"Oh, yeah. I'd marry him just for his David Hasselhof impression alone. You know I'm gonna be doing that at parties, right? "
595,"You know what I like most about him, though?"
597,The way he makes me feel about myself.
598,Yeah...
599,Hi.. how was the game?
600,Well..
601,WE WON!! Thank you! Yes!
602,Fantastic! I have one question: How is that possible?
603,Alan.
604,"He was unbelievable. He was like that-that-that Bugs Bunny cartoon where Bugs is playing all the positions, right, but instead of Bugs it was first base-Alan, second base-Alan, third base-..."
605,"I mean, it-it was like, it was like he made us into a team."
606,"Yep, we sure showed those Hassidic jewellers a thing or two about softball.."
607,Can I ask you guys a question? D'you ever think that Alan is maybe.. sometimes..
609,"..I dunno, a little too Alan?"
610,"Well, no. That's impossible. You can never be too Alan."
611,"Yeah, it's his, uh, innate Alan-ness that-that-that we adore."
612,I personally could have a gallon of Alan.
613,"Hey, Lizzie."
614,"Hey, Weird Girl."
615,I brought you alphabet soup.
616,Did you pick out the vowels?
617,"Yes. But I left in the Ys. 'Cause, y'know, ""sometimes y"". Uh, I also have something else for you. "
618,Saltines?
619,"No, but would you like a thousand dollars and a football phone?"
620,"What?  Oh my God, there's really money in here."
621,I know.
622,"Weird Girl, what are you doing?"
623,"No, I want you to have it. I don't want it."
624,"No, no, I ha-I have to give you something."
625,"Oh, that's fine, no."
626,Would you like my tin-foil hat?
627,"No. 'Cause you need that. No, it's okay, thanks."
628,"Please, let me do something."
629,"Okay, alright, you buy me a soda, and then we're even. Okay?"
632,Keep the change.  Sure you don't wanna pretzel?
633,"No, I'm fine."
634,See ya.
635,Huh!
636,A thumb?!
637,Eww!
638,"I know! I know, I opened it up and there it was, just floating in there, like this tiny little hitch-hiker!"
639,"Well, maybe it's a contest, y'know? Like, collect all five?"
640,"Does, um, anyone wanna see?"
641,Nooo! 
642,"Oh, hey, don't do that! Cut it out!"
643,It's worse than the thumb!
644,"Hey, this is so unfair!"
645,"Oh, why is it unfair?"
646,"So I have a flaw! Big deal! Like Joey's constant knuckle-cracking isn't annoying? And Ross, with his over-pronouncing every single word? And Monica, with that snort when she laughs? I mean, what the hell is that thing? ...I accept all those flaws, why can't you accept me for this?"
647,...Does the knuckle-cracking bother everybody?
648,"Well, I-I could live without it."
649,"Well, is it, like, a little annoying, or is it like when Phoebe chews her hair?"
650,"Oh, now, don't listen to him, Pheebs, I think it's endearing."
651,"Oh,  ""you do, do you""?"
652,"You know, there's nothing wrong with speaking correctly."
653,"""Indeed there isn't""... I should really get back to work."
654,"Yeah, 'cause otherwise someone might get what they actually ordered."
655,"Ohh-ho-hooohhh. The hair comes out, and the gloves come on."
656,Did you ever go out with a guy your friends all really like?
657,No. 
658,"Okay.. Well, I'm going out with a guy my friends all really like. "
659,"Waitwait.. we talking about the coyotes here? All right, a cow got through!"
660,"Can you believe it? ...Y'know what? I just don't feel the thing. I mean, they feel the thing, I don't feel the thing."
661,"Honey.. you should always feel the thing. Listen, if that's how you feel about the guy, Monica, dump him!"
662,I know.. it's gonna be really hard.
663,"Well, he's a big boy, he'll get over it."
664,"No, he'll be fine. It's the other five I'm worried about."
665,Do you have any respect for your body?
666,Don't you realise what you're-you're doing to yourself?
667,"Hey, y'know, I have had it with you guys and your cancer and your emphysema and your heart disease. The bottom line is, smoking is cool, and you know it."
668,"Chandler? It's Alan, he wants to speak to you."
669,"Really? He does?  Hey, buddy, what's up! Oh, she told you about that, huh. Well, yeah, I have one now and then. Well, yeah, now. Well, it's not that big- ..well, that's true,.. Gee, y'know, no-one- no-one's ever put it like that before. Well, okay, thanks!  "
670,"God, he's good."
671,If only he were a woman.
673,"Ooh, Lambchop. How old is that sock? If I had a sock on my hand for thirty years it'd be talking too."
674,Okay. I think it's time to change somebody's nicotine patch. 
675,Hey. Where's Joey?
676,"Joey ate my last stick of gum, so I k*lled him. Do you think that was wrong?"
677,I think he's across the hall.
678,Thanks. 
679,There y'go.
680,"Ooh, I'm alive with pleasure now."
681,"Hey Pheebs, you gonna have the rest of that Pop-Tart?.. Pheebs?"
682,Does anyone want the rest of this Pop-Tart?
683,"Hey, I might!"
684,"Sorry. ..Y'know, those stupid soda people gave me seven thousand dollars for the thumb."
685,You're kidding. Oh my God.
686,"And on my way over here, I stepped in gum. ...What is up with the universe?!"
687,What's going on?
688,Nothing. I just think it's nice when we're all here together.
689,Even nicer when everyone gets to wear their underwear..
690,"Uh, Joey.."
691,"Oh, God!  "
693,Oh! That was Lambchop!
694,"Please, guys, we have to talk."
695,"Wait, wait, I'm getting a deja vu...no, I'm not."
696,"Alright, we have to talk."
697,There it is!
698,"Okay. It's-it's about Alan. There's something that you should know. I mean, there's really no easy way to say this.. uh.. I've decided to break up with Alan."
699,Is there somebody else?
700,"No, nononono.. it's just.. things change. People change."
701,We didn't change..
702,So that's it? It's over? Just like that?
703,"You know.. you let your guard down, you start to really care about someone, and I just- I- "
704,"Look, I- I could go on pretending-"
706,"-but that wouldn't be fair to me, it wouldn't be fair to Alan- It wouldn't be fair to you!"
707,"Who-who wants fair? Y'know, I just want things back. Y'know, the way they were."
708,I'm sorry..
709,"Oh, she's sorry! I feel better!"
710,"I just can't believe this! I mean, with the holidays coming up- I wanted him to meet my family-"
711,I'll meet somone else. There'll be other Alans.
712,"Oh, yeah! Right!"
713,Are you guys gonna be okay?
714,"Hey hey, we'll be fine. We're just gonna need a little time."
715,I understand.
716,Wow. 
717,"I'm, I'm really sorry."
718,"Yeah, I'm sorry too. But, I gotta tell you, I am a little relieved. "
719,Relieved?
720,"Yeah, well, I had a great time with you.. I just can't stand your friends."
721,Remember when we went to Central Park and rented boats?.. That was fun.
722,Yeah. He could row like a viking.
724,Mmm. 
725,So how'd it go?
726,"Oh, y'know.."
727,Did he mention us?
728,He said he's really gonna miss you guys. 
729,"You had a rough day, huh.. c'mere. "
730,...That's it. I'm getting cigarettes.
731,No no no!
732,"I don't care, I don't care! Game's over! I'm weak! I've gotta smoke! I've gotta have the smoke!"
733,If you never smoke again I'll give you seven thousand dollars!
734,"Yeah, alright."
735,Alright. Phoebe?
736,"Okay, okay. If I were omnipotent for a day, I would want, um, world peace, no more hunger, good things for the rain-forest...And bigger boobs!"
737,"Yeah, see.. you took mine. Chandler, what about you?"
738,"Uh, if I were omnipotent for a day, I'd.. make myself omnipotent forever."
739,"See, there's always one guy.  ""If I had a wish, I'd wish for three more wishes."""
740,"Hey Joey. Hi. Hey, buddy."
741,"Hey, Joey, what would you do if you were omnipotent?"
742,Probably k*ll myself!
743,..Excuse me?
744,"Hey, if Little Joey's dead, then I got no reason to live!"
745,"Joey, uh- OMnipotent."
746,"You are? Ross, I'm sorry.."
747,How does she do that?
748,I cannot sleep in a public place.
749,Would you look at her? She is so peaceful.
750,Oh! What what what! ...Hi.
751,"It's okay, y'know, you just nodded off again."
752,What's going on with you?
753,I got no sleep last night!
754,Why?
755,"My grandmother has this new boyfriend, and they're both kind of insecure in bed. Oh, and deaf. So they're constantly, like, having to reassure each other that they're having a good time. You have no idea how loud they are!"
756,"Well, if you want, you can stay with Rachel and me tonight."
758,"...Ninety-five, ninety-six, ninety-seven. See, I told you! Less than a hundred steps from our place to here."
759,You got waaaay too much free time.
760,"Hey! Here's the birthday boy! Ross, check it out: hockey tickets, Rangers-Penguins, tonight at the Garden, and we're taking you."
761,"Happy birthday, pal!"
762,"We love you, man. "
763,"Funny, my birthday was seven months ago."
764,So?
765,"So, I'm guessing you had an extra ticket and couldn't decide which one of you got to bring a date?"
766,"Well, aren't we Mr. ""The glass is half empty""."
767,"Oh my God, oh- is today the twentieth, October twentieth?"
768,"Oh, I was hoping you wouldn't remember."
769,Ohhh.
770,What's wrong with the twentieth?
771,Eleven days before Hallowe'en.. all the good costumes are gone?
772,"Today's the day Carol and I first.. consummated our physical relationship.  Sex. ..You know what, I-I'd better pass on the game. I think I'm just gonna go home and think about my ex-wife and her lesbian lover."
773,"The hell with hockey, let's all do that!"
774,"C'mon, Ross! You, me, Joey, ice, guys' night out, c'mon, whaddya say, big guy,  huh? huh? huh?"
775,What are you doing?
777,"C'mon, Ross!"
778,"Alright, alright, maybe it'll take my mind off it. Do you promise to buy me a big thumb finger?"
779,You got it.
780,"Look look look look look, my first pay check! Look at the window, there's my name! Hi, me! "
781,"I remember the day I got my first pay check. There was a cave in in one of the mines, and eight people were k*lled."
782,"Wow, you worked in a mine?"
783,"I worked in a Dairy Queen, why?"
784,"God, isn't this exciting? I earned this. I wiped tables for it, I steamed milk for it, and it was totally-  -not worth it. Who's FICA? Why's he getting all my money? I mean, what- Chandler, look at that."
785,"Oh, this is not that bad."
786,"Oh, you're fine, yeah, for a first job."
787,"You can totally, totally live on this."
788,"Yeah, yeah."
789,"Oh, by the way, great service tonight."
790,Oh! Yeah! 
791,Hockey!  Hockey! Hockey. 
792,Rachel?
793,Oh my God! 
794,I swear I've seen birds do this on Wild Kingdom.
795,What are you guys doing here?
796,"Well, we were in the city shopping, and your mom said you work here, aaand it's true!"
797,Look at you in the apron. You look like you're in a play.
798,"LESLIE) Look at you, you are so big I can't believe it!"
799,I know. I know! I'm a duplex.
800,So what's going on with you?
801,"Well, guess who my dad's making partner in his firm? "
802,And while we're on the subject of news.. 
803,"Look, look, I have elbows! "
804,...Poulet passes it up to Leech! 
805,Leech spots Messier in the crease- there's the pass! 
806,We'll take a brief time out while Messier stops to look at some women's shoes.
807,"Carol was wearing boots just like those the night that we- we first- y'know. Fact, she, uh- she never took'em off, 'cause we-we-  Sorry. Sorry."
809,Peach pit.
810,"Yes, Bunny?"
811,"Peach pit. That night we, uh- we had-"
812,-Peaches?
813,"Actually, nectarines, but basically.."
814,Could've been a peach.
815,"Then, uh, then we got dressed, and I-I... I walked her to the-  -the bus stop... I'm fine."
816,"Hey, that woman's got an ass like Carol's!  What? Thought we were trying to find stuff."
817,"So c'mon, you guys, tell me all the dirt!"
818,"Well, the biggest news is still you dumping Barry at the altar!"
819,Alright. Let's talk reality for a second.
821,When are you coming home?
822,"What? Guys, I'm not. "
823,"C'mon, this is us."
824,I'm not! This is what I'm doing now. I've got this job-
825,Waitressing?
826,"Okay, I'm not just waitressing. I'm.. I, um... I write the specials on the specials board, and, uh... and I, uh... I take the uh dead flowers out of the vase... Oh, and, um, sometimes Artelle lets me put the little chocolate blobbies on the cookies."
827,Well. Your mom didn't tell us about the blobbies.
828,"Hey, Rach. How was it with your friends?  Okay! How would you like some Tiki Death Punch? "
829,What's that?
830,"Weeeell, it's rum, and-"
831,Okay. 
832,"We thought since Phoebe was staying over tonight we'd have kinda like a slumber party thing. We got some trashy magazines, we got cookie dough, we got Twister.. "
833,"Ooh! Ooh! And I brought Operation! But, um, I lost the tweezers, so we can't operate. But we can prep the guy!"
834,"Uh, Rach, it's the Visa card people."
835,"Oh, God, ask them what they want."
836,"Could you please tell me what this is in reference to? ...Yes, hold on.  Um, they say there's been some unusual activity on your account."
837,But I haven't used my card in weeks!
838,"That is the unusual activity. Look, they just wanna see if you're okay."
839,"They wanna know if I'm okay. Okay.. they wanna know if I'm okay, okay, let's see. Well, let's see, the FICA guys took all my money, everyone I know is either getting married, or getting promoted, or getting pregnant, and I'm getting coffee! And it's not even for me! So if that sounds like I'm okay, okay, then you can tell them I'm okay, okay?"
840,"Uh- Rachel has left the building, can you call back?"
841,"Alright, c'mon!  Let's play Twister!"
842,"Sorry, sorry... Uh-oh."
843,What? There was ice there that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans?
844,"No, actually I was just saying it looks like we're not sitting together. But now you mention it, there was ice there that night... It was the first frost..."
845,"C'mon, sit. Just sit down, sit."
846,You should feel great about yourself! You're doing this amazing independence thing!
847,"Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything. And for what?"
848,You are just like Jack.
849,...Jack from downstairs?
850,"No, Jack and the Beanstalk."
851,"Ah, the other Jack."
852,"Yeah, right! See, he gave up something, but then he got those magic beans. And then he woke up, and there was this, this big plant outside his window, full of possibilities and stuff.. And he lived in a village, and you live in the Village.."
853,"Okay, but Pheebs, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow, I gave up an orthodontist. Okay, I-I-I know, I know I didn't love him-"
854,"Oh, see, Jack did love the cow."
855,"But see, it was a plan. Y'know, it was clear. It was figured out, and now everything's just kinda like-"
856,Floopy?
858,"So what, you're not the only one. I mean, half the time we don't know where we're going. You've just gotta figure at some point it's all gonna come together, and it's just gonna be... un-floopy."
859,"Oh, like that's a word."
860,"Okay, but Monica, what if- what if it doesn't come together? "
861,...Pheebs?
862,"Oh, well... 'cause.... you just... I don't like this question."
863,"Okay, see, see, you guys, what if we don't get magic beans? I mean, what if all we've got are.. beans?"
864,"Get him! GET HIM! Get him! Get- YESSS! Not laughing now, are ya pal!"
865,"See buddy, that's all you need, a bunch of toothless guys hitting each other with sticks."
866,Pass it! Pass it!
867,He's open! 
868,sh**t! sh**t! sh**t! 
869,"Hey, look, we're on that TV thing!"
870,'Scuse me.
871,"It says to call this number if you're not completely satisfied with this candy bar. Well, I'm not completely satisfied."
872,"Listen, it's kind of an emergency. Well, I guess you know that, or we'd be in the predicament room."
873,"Hold on.  Fill these out, sit over there. "
874,"Look, I don't wanna make any trouble, okay, but I'm in a lot of pain here, alright? My face is dented."
875,"Well, you'll have to wait your turn."
876,"Well, how long do you think it'll be?"
877,Any minute now.
878,"Hey, this-  Heyy..."
879,"I'm so sorry, you guys. I didn't mean to bring you down."
880,"No, you were right. I don't have a plan. "
881,Pizza guy.
882,Thank God. Food. 
883,Phoebe?
885,Do you have a plan?
886,I don't even have a 'pl'.
887,"Hi, one, uh, mushroom, green pepper and onion?"
888,"No, no, that's not what we ordered... We ordered a fat-free crust with extra cheese."
889,"Wait, you're not 'G.Stephanopoulos'? Man, my dad's gonna k*ll me!"
890,Wait! Did you say 'G.Stephanopoulos'?
891,"Yeah. This one goes across the street, I must have given him yours. Oh, bonehead, bonehead!"
892,"Wait, was this a-a small mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks?"
893,"Yeah, that sounds about right."
894,Was he wearing a stunning blue suit?
895,And-and a power tie?
896,"No, pretty much just a towel."
897,Oh God.
898,So you guys want me to take this back?
899,Are you nuts?! We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza!
900,"Uh, Pheebs? Who's George Snuffalopagus?"
901,Big Bird's friend.
902,I see pizza!
903,"Oh, I wanna see! Lemme see! Lemme see!  "
904,Hello? Who are we spying on?
905,"White House adviser? Clinton's campaign guy? The one with the great hair, sexy smile, really cute butt?"
906,"Oh, him, the little guy? Oh, I love him!"
907,"Ooh, wait.. wait, I see a woman."
908,Please tell me it's his mother.
909,Definitely not his mother.
910,"Oh, no..."
911,"Oh, wait, she's walking across the floor.. she's walking.. she's walking.. she's going for the pizza-  Hey, that's not for you, bitch!"
912,"Excuse me, look, we've been here for over an hour, and a lot of people less sick than my friend have gone in. I mean, that guy with the toe thing? Who's he sleeping with?"
913,"Oh, c'mon Dora, don't be mad... I know we both said some things we didn't mean, but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.  Y'know, I feel like I've lost her..  Ba-!"
914,Light still out?
916,Oh. Maybe they're- napping.
917,"Oh please, they're having sex."
918,Shut up!
919,"So, whaddya think George is like?"
920,I think he's shy.
921,Yeah?
922,Yeah. I think you have to draw him out. And then- when you do- he's a preppy animal.
923,I remember the moonlight coming through the window- and her face had the most incredible glow.
924,"Yes, the moon, the glow, the magical feeling, you did this part- Could I get some painkillers over here, please?"
925,"He's right, enough, already. What is the big deal about today? So you slept with her for the first time, so what? You slept with her for seven years after that."
926,"Look, it's just a little more complicated..."
927,"Well, what? What? What is it? That she left you? That she likes women? That she left you for another woman that likes women?"
928,"Little louder, okay, I think there's a man on the twelfth floor in a coma that didn't quite hear you..."
929,Then what?
930,My first time with Carol was.. 
932,It was my first time.
933,With Carol?
934,Oh.
935,"So in your whole life, you've only been with one-  -oh."
936,"Whoah, boy, hockey was a big mistake! There was a whole bunch of stuff we could've done tonight! "
937,"Okay. Okay, I got one. Do you remember that vegetarian pate that I made that you loved so much?"
938,Uh-huh.
939,"Well, unless goose is a vegetable...ha haaaah!"
940,"Oh! Oh! Oh! Okay, fine, fine. Now I don't feel so bad about sleeping with Jason Hurley."
941,What?! You slept with Jason?
942,You'd already broken up.
943,How long?
944,A couple hours.
945,"Oh, that's nice!"
946,"Okay, okay, okay, I got one!  Anyway- The valentine Tommy Rollerson left in your locker was really from me."
947,Excuse me?!
948,Hello? Like he was really gonna send you one?  She was a big girl.
949,"Really. Well, at least 'big girls' don't pee in their pants in seventh grade!"
950,I was laughing! You made me laugh! 
951,There he is! There he is!
952,Where?
953,Right- where we've been looking all night!
954,He is so cute!
955,"Oh, George, baby, drop the towel!"
956,"Yeah, drop it! Drop the towel! Please drop the-  -wowww."
957,Man. Can you believe he's only had sex with one woman?
958,"I think it's great. Y'know, it's sweet, it's romantic.."
960,"No, you kidding? The guy's a freak.. "
961,"Hey, buddy."
963,"Oh, that's attractive."
964,"Oh, I thought you were great in Silence of the Lambs. Oh come on, admit it! All things considered, you had fun tonight."
965,"Fun? Where was the fun? Tell me specifically, which part was the fun part? Where's my puck?"
966,"Oh, ah- the kid has it."
967,"The kid..?  Excuse me, uh, that's, that's my puck."
968,"I found it. Finders keepers, losers weepers."
969,"You gotta do it, man."
970,"Oh yeah? Well, I'm rubber, you're glue, whatever-  -can't do it.  Listen, uh- gimme back my puck."
972,"'Yes', how about. C'mere. Gimme!"
973,No! No!
974,Hey! Hey! No rough holding in my ER!
975,GIVE ME MY PUCK!! 
976,...Now that was fun.
977,"Okay, Monica: Right foot red."
978,"Could've played Monopoly, but nooooo."
980,"Okay, Pheebs: Right hand blue. Good. "
981,"Hello? Oh, uh, Rachel, it's the Visa card people."
982,"Oh, okay. Will you take my place?"
983,"Alright.  Yes, this is Rachel."
984,"Nooo!  Hello? Oh, yeah, no, I know, I-I haven't been using it much. Oh, well, thanks, but, I'm okay, really."
985,Green. To the green.
986,I've got magic beans. Never-never mind.
987,"To the left, to the left- aww! "
988,Ohhh... I'm fine.
989,Would you let it go? It's not that big a deal.
990,"Not that big a deal? It's amazing. Ok, you just reach in there, there's one little maneuver, and bam, a bra right out the sleeve. All right, as far as I'm concerned, there is nothing a guy can do that even comes close. Am I right?"
991,Come on! You guys can pee standing up.
992,"We can? All right, I'm tryin' that."
993,"Ok, you know what blows my mind? Women can see breasts any time they want. You just look down and there they are. How you get any work done is beyond me."
994,"Oh, ok, you know what I don't get? The way guys can do so many mean things, and then not even care."
995,Multiple orgasms!
996,"So, Saturday night, the big night, date night, Saturday night, Sat-ur-day night!"
997,"No plans, huh?"
998,Not a one.
999,"Not even, say, breaking up with Janice?"
1000,"Oh, right, right, shut up."
1001,"Chandler, nobody likes breaking up with someone. You just gotta do it."
1002,"No, I know, but it's just so hard, you know? I mean, you're sitting there with her, she has no idea what's happening, and then you finally get up the courage to do it, and there's the horrible awkward moment when you've handed her the note."
1003,"Why do you have to break up with her? Be a man, just stop calling."
1004,"You know, if you want, I'll do it with you."
1005,"Oh, thanks, but I think she'd feel like we're gangin' up on her."
1006,"No, I mean you break up with Janice and I'll break up with Tony."
1007,Tony?
1008,"Oh, you're breaking up with Tony?"
1009,"Yeah, I know, he's sweet, but it's just not fun anymore, you know? I don't know if it's me, or his hunger strike, or, I don't know."
1010,Does anybody want anything else?
1011,"Oh, yeah, last week you had a wonderful, nutty, chocolatey kind of a cakey pie thing.  Nothing, just, just, I'm fine."
1012,What's the matter? Why so scrunchy?
1013,It's my father. He wants to give me a Mercedes convertible.
1014,"That guy, he burns me up."
1015,"Yeah, well, it's a Mercedes if I move back home. Oh, it was horrible. He called me young lady."
1016,"Ooh, I hate when my father calls me that."
1017,"Did he give you that whole ""You're-not-up-to-this"" thing again?"
1018,"Oh, yeah, yeah. Actually, I got the extended disco version, with three choruses of ""You'll never make it on your own""."
1019,"Uh-huh, uh-huh."
1020,"Hi, Joey."
1021,"My god, Angela."
1022,"Wow, being dumped by you obviously agrees with her."
1023,Are you gonna go over there?
1024,"No, yeah, no, ok, but not yet. I don't wanna seem too eager. One Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi. That seems pretty cool.  Hey, Angela."
1025,Joey.
1026,You look good.
1027,That's because I'm wearing a dress that accents my boobs.
1028,You don't say.
1029,"So, uh, Rachel, what are you, uh, what're you doing tonight?"
1030,"Oh, big glamour night. Me and Monica at Laundorama."
1031,"Oh, you uh, you wanna hear a freaky coincidence? Guess who's doing laundry there too?"
1032,Who?
1033,"Me. Was that not clear? Hey, why don't, um, why don't I just join you both, here?"
1034,Don't you have a laundry room in your building?
1035,"Yes, I do have a laundry room in my building, um, but there's a.... rat problem. Apparently they're attracted to the dryer sheets, and they're goin' in fine, but they're comin' out all.... fluffy. Anyway, say, sevenish?"
1036,Sure.
1037,Forget it Joey. I'm with Bob now.
1038,Bob? Who the hell's Bob?
1039,"Bob is great. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. You, you go on three auditions a month and you call yourself an actor, but Bob--"
1040,"Come on, we were great together. And not just at the fun stuff, but like, talking too."
1041,"Yeah, well, sorry, Joe. You said let's just be friends, so guess what?"
1043,We're just friends.
1044,"Fine, fine, so, why don't the four of us go out and have dinner together tonight? You know, as friends?"
1045,What four of us?
1046,"You know, you and Bob, and me and my girlfriend, uh, uh, Monica."
1047,"Monica, I'm tellin' you, this guy is perfect for you."
1048,Forget it. Not after your cousin who could belch the alphabet.
1049,"Come on. This guy's great. His name's Bob. He's Angela's... brother. He's smart, he's sophisticated, and he has a real job. Me, I go on three auditions a month and call myself an actor, but Bob is--"
1050,"Oh, god help us."
1052,Ugly Naked Guy's laying kitchen tile. Eww!
1053,"Eww! Look, I'm asking a favor here. If I do this for her brother, maybe Angela will come back to me."
1054,What's going on here? You go out with tons of girls.
1055,"I know, but, I made a huge mistake. I never should have broken up with her. Will you help me? Please?"
1056,"Ok, bye.  Well, Monica's not coming, it's just gonna be me and Rachel."
1057,"Oh. Well, hold on camper, are you sure you've thought this thing through?"
1058,It's laundry. The thinking through is minimal.
1059,"It's just you and Rachel, just the two of you? This is a date. You're going on a date."
1060,Nuh-uh.
1061,Yuh-huh.
1062,"So what're you saying here? I should shave again, pick up some wine, what?"
1063,"Well, you may wanna rethink the dirty underwear. This is basically the first time she's gonna see your underwear--do you want it to be dirty?"
1065,"Oh, and uh, the fabric softener?"
1066,"Ok, ok, now what is wrong with my Snuggles? What, it says I'm a sensitive, warm kinda guy, you know, like a warm, fuzzy bear. Ok, I can pick something else up on the way."
1067,There you go.
1068,Thank you. So what does this Bob guy look like? Is he tall? Short?
1069,Yep.
1070,Which?
1071,Which what?
1072,"You've never met Bob, have you?"
1073,"No, but he's--"
1074,"Oh my god, Joey, for all we know this guy could be horribly--"
1075,"Hey, Joey."
1076,--horribly attractive. I'll be shutting up now.
1077,Where are they? Where are they?
1078,This is nice. We never do anything just the two of us.
1079,It's great. Maybe tomorrow we can rent a car and run over some puppies.
1080,"Eww, I don't wanna do that."
1081,Here we go.
1082,"Ok, have a good break-up."
1083,"Hey, Janice."
1084,"Oh, my god, I am so glad you called me. I had the most supremely awful day."
1085,"Hey, that's not good. Can I get an espresso and a latte over here, please?"
1086,"We got the proofs back from that photo sh**t, you know, the one with the little vegetables. Anyway, they pretty much sucked, so, I blew off the rest of the day, and I went shopping...... and I got you, I'm looking, I'm looking, I'm looking, I got you..."
1089,What... did you get me there?
1090,I got you--these. 
1091,Bullwinkle socks. That's so sweet.
1092,"Well, I knew you had the Rockys, and so I figured, you know, you can wear Bullwinkle and Bullwinkle, or you can wear Rocky and Rocky,or, you can mix and match, moose and squirrel. Whatever you want."
1093,That's great.
1094,"Well, I'm gonna get another espresso. Can I get you another latte?"
1095,"No, no, I'm still working on mine."
1096,That's it?
1097,"Yeah, it was really hard."
1098,"Oh, yeah, that hug looked pretty brutal."
1099,"Ok, you weren't there."
1100,"Comin' through. Move, move."
1101,"Oh, 'scuse me. I was kinda using that machine."
1102,"Yeah, well, now you're kinda not."
1103,But I saved it. I put my basket on top.
1104,"Oh, I'm sorry, is that your basket? It's really pretty. Unfortunately, I don't see suds."
1106,"No suds, no save. Ok?"
1107,What's goin' on?
1108,"Hi, uh, nothing. That horrible woman just took my machine."
1109,Was your basket on top?
1110,"Yeah, but, there were no suds."
1112,"Well, you know, no suds, no save."
1113,"No suds? Excuse me, hold on a second.  That's my friend's machine."
1114,"Hey, hey, hey, her stuff wasn't in it."
1115,"Hey, hey, hey, that's not the rule and you know it."
1116,"All right, show's over. Nothing to see here.  Ok, let's do laundry."
1117,That was amazing. I can't even send back soup.
1118,"Well, that's because you're such a sweet, gentle, uh...Do you, uh, do you...Oh, hey, uh you must need detergent."
1120,"Uberveiss. It's new, it's German, it's extra-tough."
1121,"Rach, do you uh, are you gonna separate those?"
1122,"Oh god. Oh, am I being like a total laundry spaz? I mean, am I supposed to use like one machine for shirts and another machine for pants?"
1123,"Rach, have you never done this before?"
1124,"Well, not myself, but I know other people that have. Ok, you caught me. I'm a laundry virgin."
1125,"Uh, well, don't worry, I'll use the gentle cycle. Ok, um, basically you wanna use one machine for all your whites, a whole nother machine for colors, and a third for your uh, your uh, delicates, and that would be your bras and your under-panty things."
1126,"Ok, Well, what about these are white cotton panties. Would they go with whites or delicates?"
1127,"Uh, that, that, that would be a judgment call."
1128,"He is so cute.  So, where did you guys grow up?"
1129,Brooklyn Heights.
1130,Cleveland.
1131,"How, how did that happen?"
1132,Oh my god.
1134,I suddenly had the feeling that I was falling. But I'm not.
1135,"So, you and Angela, huh?"
1136,Yep. Pretty much.
1137,"You're a lucky man. You know what I miss the most about her? That cute nibbly noise when she eats. Like a happy little squirrel, or a weasel."
1138,"Huh, I never really noticed."
1139,"Oh, yeah, yeah, listen for it."
1140,"Monica, Monica is great."
1141,"Yeah, but it's not gonna last. She's too much for me in bed. Sexually."
1142,"I've gotta tell you, Bob is terrific."
1143,"Yeah, isn't he?"
1144,"It is so great to meet a guy who is smart and funny, and has an emotional age beyond, like eight."
1145,You know what else? He's unbelievable in bed.
1146,Wow. My brother never even told me when he lost his virginity.
1147,Huh. That's nice.
1148,"Ok, you can do this. It's just like pulling off a Band-aid. Just do it really fast, and then the wound is exposed."
1149,"Janice. Hi, Janice. Ok, here we go. I don't think we should go out anymore. Janice."
1150,"All right. Well, there you go.  Stop it, stop it, stop it."
1151,"Ok, I know this is gonna sound really stupid, but I feel that if I can do this, you know, if I can actually do my own laundry, there isn't anything I can't do."
1152,"That does not sound stupid to me. You know, it's like the first time I had to make dinner for myself, after Carol left me?  I'm sorry, that's all the time we have. Next on Ross... Uh-oh."
1153,What uh-oh?
1154,"Uh-oh, uh-oh, the laundry's done. It's, uh, it's a song. The laundry song that we sing.  Uh-oh the laundry's done, uh-oh, uh-oh."
1155,"Ross, what's the matter?"
1156,"Nothing, nothing. Lee-lo, the laundry's done."
1157,"Come on, show me."
1158,"All right, all right, it's just that you left a red sock in with all your whites, and now, everything's kinda pink."
1159,"Oh, everything's pink."
1160,"Yeah, uh, except for the red sock, which is still red. I'm sorry, please don't be upset, it could happen to anyone."
1161,"Except it didn't. It happened to me. Oh, god, I'm gonna look like a big marshmallow peep. What am I doing? What am I doing? My father's right. I can't live on my own! I can't even do laundry!"
1162,"Something went wrong with Underdog, and they couldn't get his head to inflate. So anyway, um, his head is like flopping down Broadway, right, and I'm just thinking... how inappropriate this is. Um, I've got something in my eye, uh, Joey, could we check it in the light, please?"
1165,Hello! Were we at the same table? It's like... cocktails in Appalachia.
1166,"Come on, they're close."
1167,Close? She's got her tongue in his ear.
1168,"Oh, like you've never gotten a little rambunctious with Ross."
1169,"Joey, this is sick, it's disgusting, it's, it's--not really true, is it?"
1170,"Well, who's to say what's true? I mean--"
1171,"Oh my god, what were you thinking?"
1172,"All right, look, I'm not proud of this, ok? Well, maybe I am a little."
1173,Oh!
1174,Ow!
1175,I'm outta here.
1176,"Wait, wait, wait. You want him, I want her. He likes you."
1178,"Yeah. I'm thinking, if we put our heads together, between the two of us, we can break them up."
1179,"I'm so sorry, I can't believe I did this, but I couldn't stop laughing at your Norman Mailer story."
1180,"Uh, waiter, one more plate of chicken wings over here."
1181,"Here's the thing, Janice. You know, I mean, it's like we're different. I'm like the bing, bing, bing. You're like the boom, boom, ... boom."
1183,"Oh, my god, I'm so sorry. Are you ok?"
1184,"Ow. Um, it's just my lens. It's just my lens. I'll be right back."
1185,I hit her in the eye! I hit her in the eye! This is the worst break-up in the history of the world.
1186,Oh my god.  How many of those have you had?
1187,"Oh, I don't know, a million?"
1188,"Chandler, easy, easy. Go to your happy place. La la la la la la la."
1189,I'm fine.
1190,All right.
1191,I'm not fine. Here she comes.
1192,Wait here. Breathe.
1194,It's like a gift.
1195,We should always always break up together.
1196,"Oh, I'd like that."
1197,You got the clothes clean. Now that's the important part.
1198,"Oh, I guess. Except everything looks like jammies now."
1199,"Whoa, I'm sorry. Excuse me. We had this cart."
1200,"Yeah, well, I had a 24-inch waist. You lose things. Now come on, get outta my way."
1201,"I'm sorry, you know, maybe I wasn't being clear. Uh, this is our cart."
1202,"Hey, hey, hey there aren't any clothes in it."
1203,"Hey, hey, hey, hey, quit making up rules!"
1204,Let go!
1205,"All right, listen, missy. If you want this cart, you're gonna have to take me with it!"
1206,Yes! Did you see that?
1207,"You were incredible! Brand new woman, ladies and gentlemen."
1208,I could not have done this without you.
1209,"Ok, um, uh, more clothes in the dryer?  I'm fine, I'm fine."
1212,"Oh, are you sure you're ok?"
1214,Does it still hurt?
1216,What a neat idea. All your clothes match. I'm gonna do this.
1218,"Hey, how'd it go?"
1219,Excellent.
1220,"We ripped that couple apart, and kept the pieces for ourselves."
1221,"What a beautiful story. Hey, I'm fine by the way."
1222,"Oh, I'm sorry."
1223,Where's Chandler?
1224,"Oh, he needed some time to grieve."
1225,I'm free! I'm free!
1226,That oughta do it.
1227,"Ooh! Look! Look! Look! Look, there's Joey's picture! This is so exciting!"
1228,"You can always spot someone who's never seen one of his plays before. Notice, no fear, no sense of impending doom..."
1229,"The exclamation point in the title scares me.  Y'know, it's not just Freud, it's Freud!"
1230,"Oh, shhh, shh. Magic is about to happen."
1231, TALKING TO A FEMALE PATIENT)
1232,"Vell, Eva, ve've done some excellent vork here, and I vould have to say, your pwoblem is qviiite clear. "
1233,God. I feel violated.
1234,"Did anybody else feel they just wanted to peel the skin off their body, to have something else to do?"
1235,"Ross, ten o'clock."
1236,Is it? Feels like two.
1237,"No, ten o'clock."
1239,"There's a beautiful woman at eight, nine, ten o'clock!"
1240,Oh. Hel-lo!
1241,"She's amazing! She makes the women that I dream about look like short, fat, bald men!"
1242,"Well, go over to her! She's not with anyone."
1243,"Oh yeah, and what would my opening line be? 'Excuse me. Blarrglarrghh.'"
1244,"Oh, c'mon. She's a person, you can do it!"
1245,"Oh please, could she be more out of my league? Ross, back me up here."
1246,He could never get a woman like that in a million years.
1247,"Thank you, buddy."
1248,"Oh, oh, but y'know, you always see these really beautiful women with these really nothing guys, you could be one of those guys."
1249,You could do that!
1250,Y'think?
1251,Yeah!
1252,"Oh God, I can't believe I'm even considering this... I'm very very aware of my tongue..."
1253,C'mon! C'mon!
1254,Here goes. 
1255,...Yes?
1256,"Hi.... um... okay, next word... would be... Chandler! Chandler is my name, and, uh... ...hi."
1257,"Yes, you said that."
1258,"Yes, yes I did, but what I didn't say was what I was about to say, what I wanted to say was, uh... would you like to go out with me sometime, thankyou, goodnight.  "
1259,Chandler?
1260,Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
1261,Whadja think?
1262,...Hey! You're in a play! I didn't know you could dance! You had a beard!
1263,"C'mon, you guys, it wasn't that bad. It was better than that thing I did with the trolls, at least you got to see my head."
1264,Saw your head. Saw your head.
1265,"She said yes!! She said yes!!  Awful play, man. Whoah.  Her name's Aurora, and she's Italian, and she pronounces my name 'Chand-lrr'. 'Chand-lrr'. I think I like it better that way.  Oh, listen, the usher gave me this to give to you. "
1266,What is it?
1267,"The Estelle Leonard Talent Agency. Wow, an agency left me its card! Maybe they wanna sign me!"
1268,Based on this play? ...Based on this play!
1269,"Hey, kids. "
1270,Hey.
1271,"No, 'cause this line is passion, and this is... just a line."
1272,"Well, I can't believe I've been here almost seven seconds and you haven't asked me how my date went."
1273,"Oh, right, right. How was your date, 'Chand-lrr'?"
1274,It was unbelievable. I-I've never met anyone like her. She's had the most amazing life! She was in the Israeli army...
1275,"...Luckily none of the b*ll*ts hit the engine block. So, we made it to the border, but just barely, and I- ...I've been talking about myself all night long, I'm sorry. What about you? Tell me one of your stories."
1276,"Alright. Once I got on the subway, right, and it was at night, and I rode it all the way to Brooklyn... just for the hell of it."
1277,We talked 'til like two. It was this perfect evening... more or less.
1278,...All of a sudden we realised we were in Yammon. 
1279,"Oh, I'm sorry, so 'we' is?"
1280,'We' would be me and Rick.
1281,Who's Rick?
1283,My husband.
1284,Ooooohhh.
1285,"Oh, so you're divorced?"
1287,"Oh, I'm sorry, then you're widowed?...Hopefully?"
1288,"No, I'm still married."
1289,"So tell me, how do- how do you think your husband would feel about you sitting here with me?...Sliding your foot so far up my pant leg you can count the change in my pocket?"
1290,"Don't worry. I imagine he'd be okay with you because really, he's okay with Ethan."
1291,"Ethan? There's, there's an Ethan?"
1292,Mmmm... Ethan is my... boyfriend.
1293,What?!
1294,"So explain something to me here, uh, what kind of a relationship do you imagine us having if you already have a husband and a boyfriend?"
1295,I suppose mainly sexual.
1296,...Hm.
1297,Oh. I'm sorry it didn't work out.
1298,What 'not work out'? I'm seeing her again on Thursday. Didn't you listen to the story?
1299,"Didn't you listen to the story? I mean, this is twisted! How could you get involved with a woman like this?"
1300,"Well, y'know, I had some trouble with it at first too, but the way I look at it is, I get all the good stuff: all the fun, all the talking, all the sex; and none of the responsibility. I mean, this is every guy's fantasy!"
1301,"Oh, yeah. That is not true. Ross, is this your fantasy?"
1302,"No, of course not!  ...Yeah, yeah, it is."
1303,What? So you guys don't mind going out with someone else who's going out with someone else?
1304,I couldn't do it.
1305,"Good for you, Joey."
1306,"When I'm with a woman, I need to know that I'm going out with more people than she is."
1307,"Well, y'know, monogamy can be a, uh, tricky concept. I mean, anthropologically speaking-"
1308,"Fine. Fine, alright, now you'll never know."
1309,"We're kidding. C'mon, tell us!"
1310,Yeah! C'mon!
1311,"Alright. There's a theory, put forth by Richard Leakey-"
1312,Tah-daaah!
1313,Are we greeting each other this way now? 'Cause I like that.
1314,"Look! I cleaned! I did the windows, I did the floors... I even used all the attachments on the vacuum, except that little round one with the bristles, I don't know what that's for."
1315,"Oh yeah, nobody knows. And we're not supposed to ask."
1316,"Well, whaddya think?"
1317,Very clean! It looks great! Terrific!
1318,...Oh! I-I see you moved the green ottoman.
1319,Uh-oh...
1320,How-how did that happen?
1321,"I dunno.. I-I thought it looked better there. And I- and also, it's an extra seat around the coffee table."
1322,"Yeah, yeah, it's interesting.. but y'know what? Just for fun, let's see what it looked like in the old spot.  Alright, just to compare. Let's see. Well, it looks good there too. Let's just leave it there for a while."
1323,I can't believe you tried to move the green ottoman.
1324,"Thank God you didn't try to fan out the magazines. I mean, she'll scratch your eyes right out."
1325,"You guys, I am not that bad!"
1326,"Yeah, you are, Monica. Remember when I lived with you? You were like, a little, y'know,  Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!"
1327,That is so unfair!
1328,"Oh c'mon! When we were kids, yours was the only Raggedy Ann doll that wasn't raggedy!"
1329,"Okay, so I'm responsible, I'm organised. But hey, I can be a kook."
1330,"Alright, you madcap gal. Try to imagine this. The phone bill arrives, but you don't pay it right away."
1331,Why not?
1332,Because you're a kook! Instead you wait until they send you a notice.
1333,I could do that.
1334,"Okay, uh, you let me go grocery shopping, and I buy laundry detergent, but it's not the one with the easy-pour spout."
1335,Why would someone do that?! ...One might wonder.
1336,"Someone's left a glass on the coffee table. There's no coaster. It's a cold drink, it's a hot day. Little beads of condensation are inching their way closer and closer to the surface of the wood..."
1337,STOP IT!! ...Oh my God. It's true! Who am I?
1338,Monica? You're Mom.
1339,Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree! Ree!
1340,"Uh huh.. uh huh... oh my God! Okay! Okay, I'll be there!  That was my agent.  My agent has just gotten me a job- in the new Al Pacino movie!"
1341,Oh my God! Whoah!
1342,"Well, what's the part?"
1343,Can you believe this? Al Pacino! This guy's the reason I became an actor! 'I'm out of order? Pfeeeh. You're out of order! This whole courtroom's out of order!'
1344,"Seriously, what-what's the part?"
1345,"'Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!'"
1346,"C'mon, seriously, Joey, what's the part?"
1347,...I'm his 
1348,"..You're, you're 'mah mah mah' what?"
1349,"...I'm his butt double. 'Kay? I play Al Pacino's butt. Alright? He goes into the shower, and then- I'm his butt."
1350,Oh my God.
1351,"C'mon, you guys. This is a real movie, and Al Pacino's in it, and that's big!"
1352,"Oh no, it's terrific, it's- it's- y'know, you deserve this, after all your years of struggling, you've finally been able to cr*ck your way into showbusiness."
1353,"Okay, okay, fine! Make jokes, I don't care! This is a big break for me!"
1354,"You're right, you're right, it is...So you gonna invite us all to the big opening?"
1355,"Alright, alright, alright... "
1356,Here. I need to borrow some moisturizer.
1357,For what?
1358,Whaddya think? Today's the big day!
1359,"Oh my God. Okay, go into the bathroom, use whatever you want, just don't ever tell me what you did in there."
1360,Thank you! 
1361,Where's Joey? His mom's on the phone.
1362,He's in the bathroom. I don't think you wanna go in there!
1363,"C'mon, we're roommates!  My eyes!! My eyes!!"
1364,I warned you...
1365,Who is being loud?
1366,"Oh, that would be Monica. Hey, listen, I wanna borrow a coupla things, Aurora spent the night, I really wanna make her breakfast."
1367,"Oh, you got the whole night, huh?"
1368,"Yeah, well, I only have twenty minutes until Ethan, so, y'know.. "
1369,"Ooh, do I sense a little bit of resentment?"
1370,"No, no resentment, believe me, it's worth it. 'Kay? Y'know in a relationship you have these key moments that you know you'll remember for the rest of your life? Well, every- single- second is like that with Aurora.. and I've just wasted about thirty-five of them talking to you people, so, uh.. Monica, can you help me with the door? "
1371,"Sure. Oh, um, Chandler? Y'know, the-the old Monica would-would remind you to scrub that Teflon pan with a plastic brush...But I'm not gonna do that. "
1372,"...Dammit, hire the girl!  Okay, everybody ready?"
1373,"Uh, listen, I just wanna thank you for this great opportunity."
1374,Lose the robe.
1375,Me?
1376,That would work.
1377,Right. Okay. Losing the robe.  And the robe is lost.
1378,"Okay, everybody, we'd like to get this in one take, please. Let's roll it.. water's working .. and... action."
1379,"And cut. Hey, Butt Guy, what the hell are you doing?"
1380,"Well, I'm- I'm showering."
1381,"No, that was clenching."
1382,"Oh. Well, the way I see it, the guy's upset here, y'know? I mean, his wife's dead, his brother's missing... I think his butt would be angry here."
1383,"I think his butt would like to get this sh*t before lunch. Once again, rolling... water working... and action....and cut. What was that?"
1384,I was going for quiet desperation. But if you have to ask...
1385,"God, I love these fingers..."
1387,"No, actually I meant my fingers. Look at 'em, look at how happy they are."
1388,"Oh my God, I'm late. "
1389,"Oh no nonononononnononono, don't go.. "
1391,Don't go.
1392,"Okay. Oh no, I have to."
1393,"Too bad, she's leaving."
1394,I'm sorry. He'll be waiting for me.
1395,"Well, I thought- I thought you talked to Rick."
1396,It's not Rick.
1397,"What, Ethan? He got to spend the whole day with you!"
1398,"No, it's-it's Andrew. "
1399,"I know there'll be many moments in the years to come when I'll regret asking the following question, but- And Andrew is?"
1400,He's... new.
1401,"Oh, so what you're saying is you're not completely fulfilled by Rick, Ethan and myself?"
1402,"No, that's not exactly what I was.."
1403,"Well, y'know, most women would k*ll for three guys like us."
1404,So what do you want?
1405,You.
1406,You have me!
1407,"Nono, just you."
1408,Whaddyou mean?
1409,Lose the other guys.
1410,"...Like, ...all of them?"
1411,"C'mon, we're great together, why not?"
1412,"Why can't we just have what we have now? Why can't we just talk, and laugh, and make love, without feeling obligated to one another... and up until tonight I thought that's what you wanted too."
1413,"...Well, y'know, part of me wants that, but it's like I'm two guys, y'know? I mean, one guy's going 'Shut up! This is great!' But there's this other guy. Actually it's the same guy that wells up every time that Grinch's heart grows three sizes and breaks that measuring device... And he's saying, y'know, 'This is too hard! Get out! Get out!'"
1414,So... which one of the two guys will you listen to?
1415,"I don't know, I-I have to listen to both of them, they don't exactly let each other finish..."
1416,Which one?
1417,...The second guy.
1418,"Well, call me if you change your mind."
1419,"Sorry, the first guy runs the lips."
1420,"Look at it this way: you dumped her. Right? I mean, this woman was unbelievably sexy, and beautiful, intelligent, unattainable... Tell me why you did this again?"
1422,"Hey, waitwait, aren't you the guy that plays the butt in the new Al Pacino movie?"
1423,Nope.
1424,"No? What happened, big guy?"
1425,'Big guy'?
1426,It felt like a 'big guy' moment.
1427,I got fired.
1429,"Yeah, they said I acted too much with it. I told everybody about this! Now everybody's gonna go to the theatre, expecting to see me, and-"
1430,"Oh, Joey, you know what, no-one is gonna be able to tell."
1431,My mom will.
1432,Something so sweet and... disturbing about that.
1433,"Y'know, I've done nothing but crappy plays for six years. And I finally get my sh*t, and I blow it!"
1434,Maybe this wasn't your sh*t.
1435,"Yeah, I mean- I think when it's your sh*t, y'know, you-you know it's your sh*t. Did it- feel like your sh*t..?"
1436,"Hard to tell, I was naked."
1437,"No, I don't think this was your sh*t. I mean, I don't even think you just get one sh*t. I really believe big things are gonna happen for you, I do! You've gotta just keep thinking about the day that some kid is gonna run up to his friends and go 'I got the part! I got the part! I'm gonna be Joey Tribbiani's ass!'."
1438,Yeah? That's so nice! 
1439,"I'm sorry, Joey. I'm gonna go to bed, guys. "
1440,Night.
1441,"Uh, Mon, you-you gonna leave your shoes out here?"
1442,Uh-huh!
1443,Really? Just casually strewn about in that reckless haphazard manner?
1444,"Doesn't matter, I'll get 'em tomorrow. Or not. Whenever. "
1445,She is a kook.
1446,"If it bothers you that much, just go out and get the shoes. No. Don't do this. This is stupid! I don't have to prove anything, I'm gonna go get them...But then everyone will know. Unless I get them, and then wake up really early and put them back! ...I need help!  "
1447,"Everybody? Shh, shhh. Uhhh... Central Perk is proud to present the music of Miss Phoebe Buffay."
1448,"Hi. Um, I want to start with a song thats about that moment when you suddenly realize what life is all about. OK, here we go.  OK, thank you very much."
1449,"Oh, great. This is just..."
1450,"Wow, this is so cool, you guys. The entire city is blacked out!"
1451,"Mom says it's all of Manhattan, parts of Brooklyn and Queens, and they have no idea when it's coming back on."
1452,"Wow, you guys, this is big."
1453,"Pants and a sweater? Why, mom? Who am I gonna meet in a blackout? Power company guys? Eligible looters? Could we talk about this later? OK. "
1454,Can I borrow the phone? I want to call my apartment and check on my grandma.  What's my number?
1455,"Well, I never call me."
1456,"Oh my God, it's that Victoria's Secret model. Something... something Goodacre."
1457,"Hi Mom, it's Jill."
1458,"She's right, it's Jill. Jill Goodacre. Oh my God. I am trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!  Is it a vestibule? Maybe it's an atrium. Oh, yeah, that is the part to focus on, you idiot!"
1459,"Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just stuck at the bank, in an ATM vestibule."
1460,Jill says vestibule... I'm going with vestibule.
1461,"I'm fine. No, I'm not alone... I don't know, some guy."
1462,"Oh! Some guy. Some guy. 'Hey Jill, I saw you with some guy last night. Yes, he was some guy."
1463,Hi everyone.
1464,"And officiating at tonight's blackout, is Rabbi Tribbiani."
1465,"Well, Chandler's old roomate was Jewish, and these are the only candles we have, so... Happy Chanukah, everyone."
1466,"Eww, look. Ugly Naked Guy lit a bunch of candles."
1467,That had to hurt!
1468,"Alright, alright, alright. It's been fourteen and a half minutes and you still have not said one word. Oh God, do something. Just make contact, smile!"
1469,There you go!
1470,You're definitely scaring here.
1471,Would you like to call somebody? 
1472,"Yeah, about 300 guys I went to high school with. Yeah, thanks. "
1473,Hello?
1474,"Hey, it's me."
1475,It's Chandler!  Are you OK?
1476,"Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm trppd in an ATM vstbl wth Jll Gdcr."
1478,I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth Jll Gdcr!
1479,I have no idea what you just said.
1480,Put Joey on the phone.
1481,What's up man?
1482,I'm trppd... in an ATM vstbl... wth JLL GDCR.
1483,"Oh my God! He's trapped in an ATM vestibule with Jill Goodacre!  Chandler, listen. "
1484,"Yeah, like that thought never entered my mind."
1485,"Alright, somebody."
1486,"OK, I'll go. OK, senior year of college... on a pool table."
1487,Whoooaa!
1488,That's my sister.
1489,OK... my weirdest place would have to be... the women's room on the second floor of the New York CIty public library.
1490,Oh my God! What were you doing in a library?
1491,"Phoebs, what about you?"
1492,Oh... Milwaukee.
1493,Um... Ross?
1494,"Disneyland, 1989, 'It's a Small World After All.'"
1495,No way!
1496,"The ride broke down. So, Carol and I went behind a couple of those mechanical Dutch children... then they fixed the ride, and we were asked never to return to the Magic Kingdom."
1497,"Oh, Rachel."
1498,"Oh come on, I already went."
1499,You did not go!
1500,Come on.
1501,"Oh, alright. The weirdest place would have to be... ... oh, the foot of the bed."
1502,Step back.
1503,We have a winner!
1504,"I just never had a relationship with that kind of passion, you know, where you have to have somebody right there, in the middle of a theme park."
1505,"Well, it was the only thing to do there that didn't have a line."
1506,"There, well, see? Barry wouldn't even kiss me on a miniature golf course."
1508,"No, he said we were holding up the people behind us."
1509,And you didn't marry him because...?
1510,"I mean, do you think there are people who go through life never having that kind of..."
1511,"Probably. But you know, I'll tell you something. Passion is way overrated."
1512,Yeah right.
1513,"It is. Eventually, it kind of... burns out. But hopefully, what you're left with is trust, and security, and... well, in the case of my ex-wife, lesbianism. So, you know, for all of those people who miss out on that passion... thing, there's all that other good stuff."
1514,OK.
1515,"But, um... I don't think that's going to be you."
1516,You don't.
1517,"Uh-uh. See, I see.... big passion in your future."
1519,Mmmm.
1520,You do?
1521,I do.
1522,"Oh Ross, you're so great. "
1523,It's never gonna happen.
1525,You and Rachel.
1526,What?  Why not?
1527,"Because you waited too long to make your move, and now you're in the friend zone."
1528,"No, no, no. I'm not in the zone."
1529,"Ross, you're mayor of the zone."
1530,"I'm taking my time, alright? I'm laying the groundwork. Yeah. I mean, every day I get just a little bit closer to..."
1531,"Priesthood! Look Ross, I'm telling you, she has no idea what you're thinking. If you don't ask her out soon you're going to end up stuck in the zone forever."
1532,"I will, I will. See, I'm waiting for the right moment.  What? What, now?"
1533,"Yeeeeaaaahhh! What's messing you up? The wine? The candles? The moonlight? You've just got to go up to her and say, 'Rachel, I think that...' "
1534,Shhhh!
1535,What are you shushing?
1536,We're shushing... because... we're trying to hear something. Listen.  Don't you hear that?
1537,Ahhhh!
1538,See?
1539,Huh. 
1540,Would you like some gum?
1541,"Um, is it sugarless?"
1542,"Sorry, it's not."
1543,"Oh, then no thanks. What the hell was that? Mental note: If Jill Goodacre offers you gum, you take it. If she offers you m*nled animal carcass, you take it."
1544,"New York City has no power, and the milk is getting sour. But to me it is not scary, 'cause I stay away from dairy.... la la la, la la, la la... "
1545,"OK, here goes."
1546,Are you going to do it?
1547,I'm going to do it.
1548,Do you want any help?
1549,"You come out there, you're a dead man."
1550,"Good luck, man."
1551,Thanks.  OK.
1552,OK. 
1553,"Hey, where are you going?"
1554,Outside.
1555,You can't go out there.
1557,Because of... the reason.
1558,And that would be?
1559,"I, um, can't tell you."
1560,"Joey, what's going on?"
1561,"OK, you've got to promise that you'll never, ever tell Ross that I told you."
1562,About what?
1563,He's planning your birthday party.
1564,Oh my God! I love him!
1565,You'd better act surprised.
1567,My surprise party!
1568,What surprise party?
1569,Oh stop it. Joey already told me.
1570,"Well, he didn't tell me."
1571,"Hey, don't look at me. This is Ross's thing."
1572,This is so typical. I'm always the last one to know everything.
1573,"No, you are not. We tell you stuff."
1574,Yuh-huh! I was the last one to know when Chandler got bitten by the peacock at the zoo. I was the last one to know when you had a crush on Joey when he was moving in.  Looks like I was second to last.
1575,Hmmm... this is so nice.
1576,"OK, I have a question. Well, actually, it's not so much a question as.. more of a general wondering... ment."
1578,"OK. Here goes. For a while now, I've been wanting to, um...."
1579,Ohhh!!!! 
1580,"Yes, yes, that's right..."
1581,"Oh, look at the little cat! "
1582,What?  Ow!
1583,"I'm on top of the world, looking down on creation and the only explanation I can find, is the wonders I've found ever since..."
1584,This is just Bactine. It won't hurt.
1585,"Sorry, that was wax."
1586,"Oh, poor little Tooty is scared to death. We should find his owner."
1587,Why don't we just put 'poor little Tooty' out in the hall?
1588,During a blackout? He'd get trampled!
1590,"You know, on second thought, gum would be perfection.  'Gum would be perfection'? 'Gum would be perfection.' Could have said 'gum would be nice,' or 'I'll have a stick,' but no, no, no, no. For me, gum is perfection. I loathe myself."
1591,"Oh no, the Mendels, they hate all living things, right?"
1592,Oh.  Hi. We just found this cat and we're looking for the owner.
1593,"Er, yeah, it's mine."
1594,He seems to hate you. Are you sure?
1595,"Yeah, it's my cat. Give me my cat."
1596,Wait a minute. What's his name?
1597,Ehhhh... B-Buttons.
1598,Bob Buttons?
1599,"Mmm. Bob Buttons. Here, Bob Buttons."
1600,Oooh! You are a very bad man!
1601,You owe me a cat.
1602,"Here, kitty-kitty. Here kitty-kitty. Where did you go, little kitty-kitty-kitty? Here kitty-kitty-kitty-kitty..."
1604,Lucky sixes....
1605,"Everybody, this is Paolo. Paolo, I want you to meet my friends. This is Monica."
1606,Hi!
1607,And Joey....
1609,And Ross.
1611,He doesn't speak much English.
1612,Monopoly!
1613,Look at that!
1614,"So, um... where did Paolo come from?"
1615,"Oh... Italy, I think."
1616,"No, I mean tonight, in the building. Suddenly. Into our lives."
1617,"Well, the cat... the cat turned out to be Paolo's cat!"
1618,"That, that is funny... .... and Rachel keeps touching him."
1619,Alright. I looked all over the building and I couldn't find the kitty anywhere.
1620,"Oh, I found him. He was Paolo's cat."
1621,Ah! Well! There you go! Last to know again! And I'm guessing... since nobody told me... this is Paolo.
1622,"Ah, Paolo, this is Phoebe."
1623,You betcha!
1624,"Ah, let's see. What next? Blow a bubble. A bubble's good. It's got a... boyish charm, it's impish. Here we go."
1625,"Nice going, imp. OK, it's OK. All I need to do is reach over and put it in my mouth. "
1626,"Good save! We're back on track, and I'm...  ..chewing someone else's gum. This is not my gum. Oh my God! Oh my God! And now you're choking."
1627,Are you alright?
1628,"My God, you're choking!  That better?"
1629,Yes... thank you. That was... that was....
1630,Perfection?
1631,"Blah blah blah, blah blah blah... blah blaaaaaah...."
1632,Wha-What did he say that was so funny?
1633,I have absolutely no idea.
1634,That's... that's classic.
1635,"Oh my God, you guys, what am I doing? What am I doing? This is so un-me!"
1636,"If you want, I'll do it."
1637,"I know, I just want to bite his bottom lip.  But I won't."
1638,"God, the first time he smiled at me... those three seconds were more exciting than three weeks in Bermuda with Barry."
1639,"You know, did you ride mopeds? 'Cause I've heard... ... oh, I see... it's not about that right now. OK."
1640,"Y'know, I know it's totally superficial and we have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't even speak the same language but Goooooooddddddd...."
1641,Paolo. Hi.
1642,Ross!
1643,"Listen. Um, listen. Something you should... know... um, Rachel and I... we're kind of a thing."
1644,Thing?
1645,"Thing, yes. Thing."
1646,"Ah, you... have the sex?"
1647,"No, no, no. Technically the... sex is not... being had, but that's... see, that's not the point. See, um, the point is that... Rachel and I should be, er, together. You know, and if you get in the.... um..."
1648,Bed?
1649,"No, no, that's not where I was going. Er, if you get in the... way, of us becoming a thing, then I would be, well, very sad."
1651,Yeah! Se vice?
1652,Si.
1653,So you do know a little English.
1654,Poco... a leetle.
1655,Do you know the word crapweasel?
1657,"That's funny, because you know, you are a huge crapweasel!"
1658,"Chandler, we've been here for an hour doing this! Now watch, it's easy."
1660,Ready? 
1661,"No, you've got to whip it."
1662,"Oh, look look look. The last candle's about to burn out. 10, 9, 8, 7... ... negative 46, negative 47, negative 48.... "
1665,Kinda... spooky without any lights.
1666,Bwah-hah-hah!
1667,"OK, guys, guys? I have the definitive one. Mwwwooooo-hah-hah..."
1668,Oh.. oh... oh.
1669,"Hey Ross. This probably isn't the best time to bring it up, but you have to throw a party for Monica."
1670,"Well, this has been fun."
1671,"Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me use your phone... and for saving my life."
1672,"Well, goodbye Chandler. I had a great blackout.  See ya."
1673,"Hi, um, I'm account number 7143457. And, uh, I don't know if you got any of that, but I would really like a copy of the tape."
1674,"Hey gorgeous, how's it going?"
1675,Dehydrated Japanese noodles under fluorescent lights... does it get better than this?
1676,"Question. You're not dating anybody, are you, because I met somebody who would be perfect for you."
1677,"Ah, y'see, perfect might be a problem. Had you said 'co-dependent', or 'self-destructive'..."
1678,Do you want a date Saturday?
1679,Yes please.
1680,"Okay. He's cute, he's funny, he's-"
1681,He's a he?
1682,"Well yeah! ...Oh God. I- just- I thought- Good, Shelley. I'm just gonna go flush myself down the toilet now-  -okay, goodbye..."
1683,"...Couldn't enjoy a cup of noodles after that. I mean, is that ridiculous? Can you believe she actually thought that?"
1684,"Um... yeah. Well, I mean, when I first met you, y'know, I thought maybe, possibly, you might be... "
1685,You did?
1686,"Yeah, but then you spent Phoebe's entire birthday party talking to my breasts, so then I figured maybe not."
1687,"Huh. Did, uh... any of the rest of you guys think that when you first met me?"
1689,"Yeah, I think so, yeah."
1690,Not me.
1691,"Nono, me neither. Although, uh, y'know, back in college, Susan Sallidor did."
1692,You're kidding! Did you tell her I wasn't?
1693,"No. No, it's just 'cause, uh, I kinda wanted to go out with her too, so I told her, actually, you were seeing Bernie Spellman... who also liked her, so..."
1694,"Well, this is fascinating. So, uh, what is it about me?"
1695,"I dunno, 'cause you're smart, you're funny..."
1696,"Ross is smart and funny, d'you ever think that about him?"
1697,Yeah! Right!
1698,WHAT IS IT?!
1699,"Okay, I-I d'know, you-you just- you have a quality."
1700,Yes. Absolutely. A quality.
1701,"Oh, oh, a quality, good, because I was worried you guys were gonna be vague about this."
1702,"Hello? Hello? Oh! Rachel, it's Paolo calling from Rome. "
1703,"Oh my God! Calling from Rome!  Bon giorno, caro mio. "
1704,So he's calling from Rome. I could do that. Just gotta go to Rome.
1705,"Monica, your dad just beeped in, but can you make it quick? Talking to Rome.  I'm talking to Rome."
1706,"Hey dad, what's up? Oh God. Ross, it's Nana."
1707,"So, uh, how's she doing?"
1708,The doctor says it's a matter of hours.
1709,"How-how are you, Mom?"
1710,"Me? I'm fine, fine. I'm glad you're here. ...What's with your hair?"
1712,What's different?
1713,Nothing.
1714,"Oh, maybe that's it."
1715,"She is unbelievable, our mother is..."
1716,"Okay, relax, relax. We are gonna be here for a while, it looks like, and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover."
1717,Oh God!
1718,The fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse. 
1719,"Oh! ...Yeah, they were gross. Oh, you know what I loved? Her Sweet 'n' Los. How she was always stealing them from- from restaurants."
1720,"Not just restaurants, from our house."
1721,Mrs. Geller?
1722,She looks so small. 
1724,"Well, at least she's with Pop-Pop and Aunt Phyllis now. "
1725,"G'bye, Nana. "
1726,"Bye, Nana. "
1728,What is going on?!
1729,"Y'know how-how the nurse said that-that Nana had passed? Well, she's not, quite.."
1731,"She's not- past, she's present, she's back."
1733,She may have d*ed.
1734,She may have d*ed?
1735,We're looking into it.
1736,"I, uh, I'll go see. "
1737,This almost never happens!
1738,Now she's passed.
1739,"I just have to know, okay. Is it my hair?"
1740,"Yes, Chandler, that's exactly what it is. It's your hair."
1741,"Yeah, you have h*m* hair."
1742,"So, um, did she..."
1743,Twice.
1744,Twice?
1745,"Oh, that sucks!"
1746,You guys okay?
1747,"I dunno, it's weird. I mean, I know she's gone, but I just don't feel, uh..."
1748,Maybe that's 'cause she's not really gone.
1749,"Nono, she's gone."
1750,We checked. A lot.
1751,"Hm, I mean maybe no-one ever really goes. Ever since my mom d*ed, every now and then, I get the feeling that she's like right here, y'know?  Oh! And Debbie, my best friend from junior high- got struck by lightning on a miniature golf course- I always get this really strong Debbie vibe whenever I use one of those little yellow pencils, y'know? ...I miss her."
1752,"Aw. Hey, Pheebs, want this? "
1753,Thanks!
1754,Sure. I just sharpened her this morning.
1755,"Now, see, I don't believe any of that. I think once you're dead, you're dead! You're gone! You're worm food!  ...So Chandler looks gay, huh?"
1756,"Y'know, I dunno who this is, but it's not Debbie. "
1757,I thought it was gonna be a closed casket.
1758,"Well, that doesn't mean she can't look nice!"
1759,"Sweetie, you think you can get in there?"
1760,I don't see why not.
1761,Here's my retainer!
1762,I was just thinking. When my time comes-
1763,Dad!
1764,"Listen to me! When my time comes, I wanna be buried at sea."
1765,You what?
1766,"I wanna be buried at sea, it looks like fun. "
1767,Define fun.
1768,"C'mon, you'll make a day of it! You'll rent a boat, pack a lunch..."
1769,"...And then we throw your body in the water... Gee, that does sound fun."
1770,"Everyone thinks they know me. Everyone says 'Jack Geller, so predictable'. Maybe after I'm gone, they'll say 'Buried at sea! Huh!'."
1771,That's probably what they'll say.
1772,I'd like that.
1773,"Hey, gorgeous."
1774,"Hey. Look, I'm sorry about yesterday, I, um-"
1775,"No, nono, don't- don't worry about it. Believe me, apparently other people have made the same mistake."
1776,Oh! Okay! Phew! 
1777,"So, uh... what do you think it is about me?"
1778,"I dunno, uh... you just have a-a..."
1779,"...Quality, right, great."
1780,"Y'know, it's a shame, because you and Lowell would've made a great couple."
1781,"Lowell? Financial Services' Lowell, that's who you saw me with?"
1782,What? He's cute!
1783,"Well, yeah... 's'no Brian in Payroll."
1784,Is Brian...?
1785,"No! Uh, I d'know! The point is, if you were gonna set me up with someone, I'd like to think you'd set me up with someone like him."
1786,"Well, I think Brian's a little out of your league."
1787,Excuse me? You don't think I could get a Brian? Because I could get a Brian. Believe you me. ...I'm really not.
1788,This one?
1790,"I have shown you everything we have. Unless you want your mother to spend eternity in a lemon yellow pant-suit, go with the g*n."
1791,"You know, whatever we pick, she would've told us it's the wrong one."
1792,You're right. We'll go with the g*n.
1793,Oh! A fine choice. I'm coming out. 
1794,Wait! We need shoes!
1795,"Okay. Um, how about these? "
1796,That's really a day shoe.
1797,And where she's going everyone else'll be dressier?
1798,Could we see something in a slimmer heel?
1799,"Okay, I have nothing in an evening shoe in the g*n. I can show you something in a silver that may work."
1800,"No, it really should be g*n."
1801,Mm. Unless we go with a different dress?
1802,"No! Nonono, wait a sec. I may have something in the back."
1803,Oh my God..
1804,"Is everything all right, dear?"
1805,"Yeah, just... just Nana stuff."
1806,"How we doing, you guys ready?"
1807,Mom already called this morning to remind me not to wear my hair up. Did you know my ears are not my best feature?
1808,Some days it's all I can think about. 
1809,"Hi, sorry I'm late, I couldn't find my bearings."
1810,"Oh, you-you mean your earrings?"
1811,What'd I say?
1812,Hm-m.
1813,Are these the shoes?
1814,Yes. Paolo sent them from Italy.
1815,"What, we-uh- we don't have shoes here, or...?"
1816,Morning. We ready to go?
1817,"Well, don't we look nice all dressed up?...It's stuff like that, isn't it?"
1818,It was a really beautiful service.
1819,"It really was. Oh, c'mere, sweetheart.  Y'know, I think it might be time for you to start using night cream."
1821,"Nothing, just your overcoat sounds remarkably like Brent Mussberger."
1822,"Check it out, Giants-Cowboys. "
1823,You're watching a football game at a funeral?
1824,"No, it's the pre-game. I'm gonna watch it at the reception."
1825,"You are a frightening, frightening man."
1826,Oh no! My new Paolo shoes!
1827,"Oh, I hope they're not ruined."
1828,"God, what a great day. ...What? Weather-wise!"
1829,"I know, uh, the air, the-the trees... even though Nana's gone there's, there's something almost, uh- I dunno, almost life-aff- "
1830,God! Ross!
1831,I'm fine. Just-just... having my worst fear realised...
1832,"Okay, don't worry, I'm just checking to see if the muscle's in spasm...huh."
1833,"What, what is it?"
1834,You missed a belt loop. 
1835,Oh! No-n-
1836,"Okay, it's in spasm."
1837,"Here, sweetie, here. I took these when I had my golfing accident. "
1838,"Oh, no-"
1839,"Sorry- Hi, I'm Dorothy's daughter."
1840,"Hi, I'm Chandler, and I have no idea who Dorothy is."
1841,"Hey, look who's up! How do you feel?"
1842,"I feel great. I feel- great, I fleel great."
1843,"Wow, those pills really worked, huh?"
1844,"Not the first two, but the second two- woooo! ...I love you guys. You guys are the greatest. I love my sister , I love Pheebs.. "
1845,Ooh! That's so nice...
1846,...Chandler! 
1848,"And listen, man, if you wanna be gay, be gay. Doesn't matter to me."
1849,You were right. 
1850,Rachel. Rachel Rachel.  I love you the most.
1851,"Oh, well you know who I love the most?"
1853,You!
1854,Oh.. you don't get it! 
1855,Whaddya got there?
1856,"Just a, uh... hearing disability."
1857,What's the score?
1858,Seventeen-fourteen Giants... three minutes to go in the third.
1859,Beautiful! 
1860,"Pheebs, could you maybe hand me a cr*cker?"
1861,Your grandmother would have hated this.
1862,"Well, sure, what with it being her funeral and all."
1863,"No, I'd be hearing about 'Why didn't I get the honey-glazed ham?', I didn't spend enough on flowers, and if I spent more she'd be saying 'Why are you wasting your money? I don't need flowers, I'm dead'."
1864,That sounds like Nana.
1865,Do you know what it's like to grow up with someone who is critical of every single thing you say?
1866,...I can imagine.
1867,"I'm telling you, it's a wonder your mother turned out to be the positive, life-affirming person that she is."
1868,"That is a wonder. So tell me something, Mom. If you had to do it all over again, I mean, if she was here right now, would you tell her?"
1869,Tell her what?
1870,"How she drove you crazy, picking on every little detail, like your hair... for example."
1871,I'm not sure I know what you're getting at.
1872,Do you think things would have been better if you'd just told her the truth?
1873,...No. I think some things are better left unsaid. I think it's nicer when people just get along. 
1874,Huh.
1875,"More wine, dear?"
1876,"Oh, I think so."
1877,Those earrings look really lovely on you.
1878,Thank you. They're yours.
1879,Actually they were Nana's.
1880,Now I'm depressed! ... Even more than I was.
1881,"Hey, who's this little naked guy?"
1882,That little naked guy would be me.
1883,"Aww, look at the little thing."
1884,"Yes, yes, fine, that is my penis. Can we be grown-ups now?"
1885,Who are those people?
1887,"Oh, that's Nana, right there in the middle.  'Me and the g*ng at Java Joe's'. "
1888,"Wow, Monica, you look just like your grandmother. How old was she there?"
1889,"Let's see, 1939... yeah, 24, 25?"
1890,Looks like a fun g*ng. 
1891,"Ooh, look look look look look! I got Monica naked!"
1892,"Nono, that would be me again. I'm, uh, just trying something."
1893,"Hey, Lowell."
1894,"Hey, Chandler."
1895,So how's it going there in Financial Services?
1896,It's like Mardi Gras without the paper mache heads. How 'bout you?
1897,"Good, good. Listen, heh, I dunno what Shelley told you about me, but, uh... I'm not."
1898,I know. That's what I told her.
1899,Really.
1901,So- you can tell?
1902,"Pretty much, most of the time. We have a kind of... radar."
1903,"So you don't think I have a, a quality?"
1904,"Speaking for my people, I'd have to say no. By the way, your friend Brian from Payroll, he is."
1905,He is?
1906,"Yup, and waaay out of your league. "
1907,"Out of my league. I could get a Brian.  If I wanted to get a Brian, I could get a Brian.  Hey, Brian."
1908,Guys? There's a somebody I'd like you to meet. 
1909,Oooh!
1910,W-wait. What is that?
1911,'That' would be Marcel. You wanna say hi?
1912,"No, no, I don't."
1913,"Oh, he is precious! Where did you get him?"
1914,My friend Bethel rescued him from some lab.
1915,That is so cruel! Why? Why would a parent name their child Bethel?
1916,"Hey, that monkey's got a Ross on its ass!"
1917,"Ross, is he gonna live with you, like, in your apartment?"
1918,"Yeah. I mean, it's been kinda quiet since Carol left, so..."
1919,Why don't you just get a roommate?
1920,"Nah, I dunno... I think you reach a certain age, having a roommate is kinda pathe-  ....sorry, that's, that's 'pathet', which is Sanskrit for 'really cool way to live'."
1921,"So you guys, I'm doing all new material tonight. I have twelve new songs about my mother's su1c1de, and one about a snowman."
1922,Might wanna open with the snowman.
1923,"Hey, Joey. Hey, buddy."
1924,"So, how'd it go?"
1925,"Ahhhhhh, I didn't get the job."
1926,How could you not get it? You were Santa last year.
1927,"I dunno. Some fat guy's sleeping with the store manager. He's not even jolly, it's all political."
1928,So what are you gonna be?
1929,"Ah, I'm gonna be one of his helpers. It's just such a slap in the face, y'know?"
1930,"Hey, do you guys know what you're doing for New Year's?  Gee, what?! What is wrong with New Year's?"
1931,"Nothing for you, you have Paolo. You don't have to face the horrible pressures of this holiday: desperate scramble to find anything with lips just so you can have someone to kiss when the ball drops!! Man, I'm talking loud!"
1932,"Well, for your information, Paolo is gonna be in Rome this New Year, so I'll be just as pathetic as the rest of you. "
1933,"Yeah, you wish!"
1934,"It's just that I'm sick of being a victim of this d*ck Clark holiday. I say this year, no dates, we make a pact. Just the six of us- dinner."
1935,"Yeah, okay. Alright."
1936,"Y'know, I was hoping for a little more enthusiasm. "
1937,Woooo! Yeah!
1938,"Phoebe, you're on."
1939,"Oh, oh, good."
1940,"Okay, hi. Ladies and gentlemen, back by popular demand, Miss Phoebe Buffay. Wooh!"
1941,"Thanks, hi. Um, I wanna start with a song that means a lot to me this time of year.  "
1942,"No. No, that's- that's okay."
1943,"Well, c'mon, if it's important enough to discuss while I'm playing, then I assume it's important enough for everyone else to hear!"
1944,That guy's going home with a note!
1945,Noth- I was- I was just saying to my-
1946,Could you speak up please?
1947,"Sorry, I wa- I was just saying to my friend that I thought you were the most beautiful woman that I'd ever seen in my- in my life. And then he said that- you said you thought"
1948,Daryl Hannah.
1949,"Daryl Hannah was the most beautiful woman that he'd ever seen in his life and I said yeah, I liked her in Splash, a lot, but not so much in- in Wall Street, I thought she had kind of a "
1950,Hard quality.
1951,"-hard quality. And uh, while Daryl Hannah is beautiful in a conventional way, you are luminous with a kind of a delicate grace. Then, uh, that-that-that's when you started yelling. "
1952,"Okay, we're gonna take a short break. "
1953,"Hey, that guy's going home with more than a note!"
1954,"Come here, Marcel. Sit here. "
1955,"Pheebs, I can't believe he hasn't kissed you yet. I mean God, by my sixth date with Paolo, I mean he had already named both my breasts! ...Ooh. Did I just share too much?"
1956,Just a smidge.
1957,"David's like, y'know, Scientist Guy. He's very methodical."
1958,I think it's romantic.
1959,Me too! Oh! Did you ever see An Officer and a Gentleman?
1961,"Well, he's kinda like the guy I went to see that with. Except, except he-he's smarter, and gentler, and sweeter... I just- I just wanna be with him all the time. Day and night, and night and day... and special occasions... "
1962,"Wait a minute, wait a minute, I see where this is going, you're gonna ask him to New Year's, aren't you. You're gonna break the pact. She's gonna break the pact."
1963,"No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, could I just?"
1964,"Yeah, 'cause I already asked Janice."
1966,"C'mon, this was a pact! This was your pact! "
1967,"I snapped, okay? I couldn't handle the pressure and I snapped."
1968,"Yeah, but Janice? That-that was like the worst breakup in history!"
1969,"I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying I snapped!"
1970,"Hi. Hi, sorry I'm late."
1971,Too many jokes... must mock Joey! 
1972,"Nice shoes, huh? "
1973,"Aah, y'k*lling me!"
1974,Ross! He's playing with my spatulas again!
1975,"Okay, look, he's not gonna hurt them, right?"
1976,Do you always have to bring him here?
1977,"I didn't wanna leave him alone. Alright? We- we had our first fight this morning. I think it has to do with my working late. I said some things that I didn't mean, and he- he threw some faeces..."
1978,"Y'know, if you're gonna work late, I could look in on him for you."
1979,"Oh, that'd be great! Okay, but if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay, and you're not like doing it as a favour to me."
1980,"Okay, but if he asks, I'm not going to lie."
1981,"...But, you can't actually test this theory, because today's particle accelerators are nowhere near powerful enough to simulate these conditions."
1982,"Okay, alright, I have a question, then. "
1983,Yuh.
1984,"Um, were you planning on kissing me ever?"
1985,"Uh, that's definitely a, uh, valid question. And, uh, the answer would be  yes. Yes I was. But, see, I wanted it to be this phenomenal kiss that happened at this phenomenal moment, because, well, 'cause it's you."
1987,"Right. But, see, the longer I waited, the more phenomenal the kiss had to be, and now we've reached a place where it's just gotta be one of those things where I just like... sweep everything off the table and throw you down on it. And, uh, I'm not really a, uh, sweeping sorta fella."
1988,"Oh, David, I, I think you are a sweeping sorta fella. I mean, you're a sweeper! ...trapped inside a physicist's body."
1989,Rrrreally.
1990,"Oh, yeah, oh, I'm sure of it. You should just do it, just sweep and throw me. "
1991,...Now? Now?
1992,"Oh yeah, right now."
1993,"Okay, okay, okay.  Y'know what, this was just really expensive.  And I'll take- this was a gift. "
1994,"Okay, now you're just kinda tidying. "
1995,"Okay, what the hell, what the hell.  You want me to actually throw you or you-you wanna just hop?"
1996,I can hop. 
1997,So tell me something. What does the phrase 'no date pact' mean to you?
1998,"I'm sorry, okay. It's just that Chandler has somebody, and Phoebe has somebody- I thought I'd ask Fun Bobby."
1999,Fun Bobby? Your ex-boyfriend Fun Bobby?
2001,You know more than one Fun Bobby?
2002,I happen to know a Fun Bob.
2003,"Okay, here we go..."
2004,"Ooh ooh ooh ooh, there's no room for milk!"
2005,There. Now there is.
2006,"Okay, so on our no-date evening, three of you now have dates."
2007,"Uh, four."
2008,Four.
2009,Five.
2010,Five. 
2011,Sorry. Paolo's catching an earlier flight.
2012,"Yeah, and I met this really hot single mom at the store. What's an elf to do?"
2013,"Okay, so I'm gonna be the only one standing there alone when the ball drops?"
2014,"Oh, c'mon. We'll have, we'll have a big party, and no-one'll know who's with who."
2015,"Hey, y'know, this is so not what I needed right now."
2016,What's the matter?
2017,"Oh, it's-it's Marcel. He keeps shutting me out, y'know? He's walking around all the time dragging his hands... "
2018,"That's so weird, I had such a blast with him the other night."
2020,"Yeah, we played, we watched TV.. that juggling thing is amazing."
2021,"What, uh... what juggling thing?"
2022,With the balled-up socks? I figured you taught him that.
2024,"Y'know, it wasn't that big a deal. He just balled up socks... and a melon..."
2025,Phoebe. Hi. 
2026,"Oh, hi Max! Hey, do you know everybody?"
2027,No. Have you seen David?
2028,"No, no, he hasn't been around."
2029,"Well, if you see him, tell him to pack his bags. We are going to Minsk."
2030,Minsk?
2031,Minsk. It's in Russia.
2032,I know where Minsk is.
2033,"We got the grant. Three years, all expenses paid."
2034,"So when, when do you leave?"
2035,January first.
2039,Hi!  What-what're you doing here?
2040,"Um, well, Max told me about Minsk, so  congratulations! This is so exciting!"
2041,It'd be even more exciting if we were going.
2042,"Oh, you're not going?  Oh, why?"
2043,"Tell her, David. 'I don't wanna go to Minsk and work with Lifson and Yamaguchi and Flench, on nonononononono. I wanna stay here and make out with my girlfriend!!' "
2044,"Thank you, Max. Thank you."
2045,So-so you're really not going?
2046,I don't know. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I just- you decide.
2047,Oh don't do that.
2048,Please.
2049,Oh no no.
2050,"No, but I'm asking-"
2051,"Oh, but I can't do that-"
2052,"No, but I can't-"
2053,"It's your thing, and-"
2054,-make the decision-
2055,"Okay, um, stay."
2056,Stay.
2058,Getting so good at that! 
2059,It was Max's stuff. 
2060,"I love this artichoke thing! Oh, don't tell me what's in it, the diet starts tomorrow! "
2061,You remember Janice.
2062,Vividly.
2064,"Hi, I'm Sandy."
2065,Sandy! Hi! C'mon in! ...You brought your kids.
2066,"Yeah. That's okay, right?"
2067,Par-tay! 
2068,That thing is not coming in here.
2069,"'That thing'? This is how you greet guests at a party? Let me ask you something, if I showed up here with my new girlfriend, she wouldn't be welcome in your home?"
2070,I'm guessing your new girlfriend wouldn't urinate on my coffee table.
2071,Okay. He was more embarrassed about that than anyone. Okay? And for him to have the courage to walk back in here like nothing happened...
2072,Alright. Just keep him away from me.
2073,"Thank you.  C'mon, Marcel, whaddya say you and I do a little mingling?  Alright, I'll, uh... catch up with you later."
2074,"Oh my gosh! Rachel, honey.. are you okay? Where-where's Paolo?"
2075,Rome. Jerk missed his flight.
2076,And then... your face is bloated?
2077,"No. Okay. I was at the airport, getting into a cab, when this woman- this blonde planet with a pocketbook- starts yelling at me. Something about how it was her cab first. And then the next thing I know she just starts- starts pulling me out by my hair! So I'm blowing my att*ck whistle thingy and three more cabs show up, and as I'm going to get into a cab she tackles me. And I hit my head on the kerb and cut my lip on my whistle...oh...everybody having fun at the party?  Are people eating my dip?"
2078,"Y'know, when I saw you at the store last week, it was probably the first time I ever mentally undressed an elf."
2079,"Wow, that's, uh, dirty."
2081,"Hey, kids..."
2082,"Look at him. I'm not saying he has to spend the whole evening with me, but at least check in."
2083,"There you are! Haaah, you got away from me!"
2084,But you found me!
2085,"Here, Ross, take our picture.  Smile! You're on Janice Camera!"
2086,k*ll me. k*ll me now. 
2087,Hey everybody! It's Fun Bobby!
2088,"Hey, sorry I'm late. But my, uh, grandfather, he- d*ed about two hours ago. But I-I-I couldn't get a flight out 'til tomorrow, so here I am!"
2089,Hey Fun Bobby! Whoah! Who d*ed?
2090,"It's gonna be an open casket, y'know, so at least I'll- I get to see him again."
2091,"Oh, I'm gonna blow this one up, and I'm gonna write 'Reunited' in glitter."
2092,"Alright, Janice, that's it! Janice... Janice... Hey, Janice, when I invited you to this party I didn't necessarily think that it meant that we-"
2093,"Oh, no. Oh, no."
2094,I'm sorry you misunderstood...
2095,"Oh my God. You listen to me, Chandler, you listen to me. One of these times is just gonna be your last chance with me. "
2096,"Oh, will you give me the thing. "
2097,"Hi, Max!"
2098,Yoko.  I've decided to go to Minsk without you.
2100,It won't be the same- but it'll still be Minsk. Happy New Year.
2102,"Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. "
2103,You're going to Minsk.
2104,"No, I'm... not going to Minsk."
2105,"Oh, you are so going to Minsk. You belong in Minsk. You can't stay here just 'cause of me."
2106,"Yes I can. Because if I go it means I have to break up with you, and I can't break up with you."
2107,"Oh yes, yes, yes you can. Just say, um, 'Phoebe, my work is my life and that's what I have to do right now'. And I say 'your work?! Your work?! How can you say that?!'. And then you say, um, 'it's tearing me apart, but I have no choice. Can't you understand that?'. And I say  'no! No! I can't understand that!'."
2108,"Uh, ow."
2109,"Ooh, sorry. Um, and, and then you put your arms around me. And then you put your arms around me.  And, um, and then you tell me that you love me and you'll never forget me."
2110,I'll never forget you.
2111,And then you say that it's almost midnight and you have to go because you don't wanna start the new year with me if you can't finish it.  I'm gonna miss you. You scientist guy.
2112,"Hi, this is d*ck Clark, live in Times Square. We're in a virtual snowstorm of confetti here in Times Square..."
2113,"There y'go, kids."
2114,And then the peacock bit me.  Please kiss me at midnight. 
2115,You seen Sandy?
2116,"Ooh. Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but she's in Monica's bedroom, getting it on with Max, that scientist geek. Ooh, look at that, I did know how to tell you."
2117,"Vrrbddy, the bll is drrbing."
2119,The bll is drrbing!
2120,In twenty seconds it'll be midnight...
2121,And the moment of joy is upon us.
2122,Looks like that no date pact thing worked out.
2123,Everybody looks so happy. I hate that.
2124,Not everybody's happy. Hey Bobby!
2125,"Y'know, I uh.. just thought I'd throw this out here. I'm no math whiz, but I do believe there are three girls and three guys right here. "
2126,I dunno. I don't feel like kissing anyone tonight.
2127,I can't kiss anyone.
2128,So I'm kissing everyone?
2129,"Nonono, you can't kiss Ross, that's your brother."
2130,Perfect. Perfect. So now everybody's getting kissed but me.
2131,"Alright, somebody kiss me. Somebody kiss me, it's midnight! Somebody kiss me!"
2132,Alrightalrightalright.  There.
2133,"I wanted this to work so much. I mean I'm still in there, changing his diapers, pickin' his fleas... but he's just phoning it in. Just so hard to accept the fact that something you love so much doesn't love you back."
2134,...I think that bitch cracked my tooth.
2135,"That is IT! You just barge in here, you don't knock-"
2136,I'm sorry!
2137,-You have no respect for anybody's privacy-
2138,"Rachel, wait, wait."
2139,"No, you wait! This is ridiculous!"
2140,Can I just say one thing?
2141,What? What?!
2142,That's a relatively open weave and I can still see your... nipular areas.
2143,Oh!!
2144,"Oh, honey, honey, tell them the story about your patient who thinks things are, like, other things. Y'know? Like, the phone rings and she takes a shower."
2145,That's pretty much it.
2146,Oops!
2147,"But you tell it really well, sweetie."
2148,"Thanks. Okay, now go away so we can talk about you."
2149,Okay. I'll miss you.
2150,Isn't he great?
2151,He's so cute! And he seems to like you so much.
2152,"I know, I know. So sweet... and so complicated. And for a shrink, he's not too shrinky, y'know?"
2153,"So, you think you'll do it on his couch?"
2154,"Oh, I don't know, I don't know. I think that's a little weird, y'know? Vinyl."
2155,Okaaay.  Any of you guys want anything else?
2156,"Oh, yes, could I have one of those-"
2157,"No, I'm sorry, we're all out of those. Anybody else?"
2159,"Did I, uh, did I miss something?"
2160,"No, she's still upset because I saw her boobies."
2161,You what? Wh- what were you doing seeing her boobies?
2162,It was an accident. Not like I was across the street with a telescope and a box of donuts.
2163,"Okay, okay, could we change the subject, please?"
2164,"Yeah, 'cause hello, these are not her boobies, these are her breasts."
2165,"Okay, Pheebs, I was hoping for more of a change."
2166,"Y'know, I don't know why you're so embarrassed, they were very nice boobies."
2167,"Nice? They were nice. I mean, that's it? I mean, mittens are nice."
2168,"Okaaay,  rock, hard place, me."
2169,You're so funny! He's really funny! I wouldn't wanna be there when- when the laughter stops.
2170,"Whoah whoah, back up there, Sparky. What'd you mean by that?"
2171,"Oh, just seems as though that maybe you have intimacy issues. Y'know, that you use your humour as a way of keeping people at a distance."
2173,"I mean hey! I just met you, I don't know you from Adam. ...Only child, right? Parents divorced before you hit puberty."
2174,"Uh-huh, how did you know that?"
2175,It's textbook.
2176,"Hey you guys. Hey, you all know my dad, right?"
2177,"Hey! Hey, Mr. Trib!"
2178,"Hey, how long are you in the city?"
2179,Just for a coupla days. I got a job mid-town. I figure I'm better off staying with the kid than hauling my ass back and forth on the ferry.  I don't know this one.
2180,"Oh, this is my friend Roger."
2182,"Hey, hey. Good to meet you, Roger."
2183,"You too, sir."
2184,"What happened to the, uh, puppet guy?"
2185,"Dad, dad. "
2186,"Oh, 'scuse me. So Ross, uh, how's the wife?  Off there too, uh? Uh, Chandler, quick, say something funny!"
2187,"Gotta go. I miss you too, I love you, but it's getting real late now-"
2188,"Hey Ma. Listen, I made the appointment with Dr. Bazida, and... Excuse me?  Did you know this isn't Ma?"
2189,Her name's Ronni. She's a pet mortician. 
2190,Sure. So how long you been... 
2191,"Remember when you were a little kid, I used to take you to the navy yard and show you the big ships?"
2192,Since then?!
2193,"No, it's only been six years. I just wanted to put a nice memory in your head so you'd know that I wasn't always such a terrible guy. ...Joe. Y'ever been in love?"
2194,...I d'know.
2195,Then y'haven't. You're burning your tomatoes.
2196,You're one to talk. 
2197,"Joe, your dad's in love big time. And the worst part of it is, it's with two different women."
2198,Oh man. Please tell me one of 'em is Ma.
2199,"Of course, course one of 'em's Ma. What's the matter with you."
2200,"It's like if you woke up one day and found out your dad was leading this double life. He's like actually some spy, working for the CIA.  That'd be cool.... This blows!"
2201,"I know, I mean, why can't parents just stay parents?  Why do they have to become people? Why do they have...  Why can't you stop staring at my breasts?"
2202,What?  What?
2203,Did you not get a good enough look the other day?
2204,"Alright, alright. We're all adults here, there's only one way to resolve this. Since you saw her boobies, I think, uh, you're gonna have to show her your pee-pee."
2205,"Y'know, I don't see that happening?"
2206,"C'mon, he's right. Tit for tat."
2207,Well I'm not showing you my 'tat'.
2209,It's Phoebe.
2210,And Rog.
2211,C'mon up.
2212,"Oh, good. Rog is here."
2213,What's the matter with Rog?
2215,"Oh, it's nothing, it's a little thing... I hate that guy."
2216,"What, so he was a little analytical. That's what he does, y'know? C'mon, he's not that bad."
2217,"Y'see, that's where you're wrong. Why would I marry her if I thought on any level that-that she was a lesbian?"
2218,I dunno. Maybe you wanted your marriage to fail.
2219,Why? Why would I- why? Why? Why? Why?
2220,"I don't know. Maybe- maybe low self-esteem, maybe- maybe to compensate for overshadowing a sibling, maybe you-"
2221,"Waitwait, go back to that sibling thing."
2222,"Well, I don't know. I mean, it's conceivable that you wanted to sabotage your marriage so that the sibling would feel less of a failure in the eyes of the parents."
2223,That- that's ridiculous! I don't feel guilty for her failures!
2224,Oh! So you think I'm a failure!
2225,Isn't he good?
2226,"Nonono, that-that's not what I was saying..."
2227,"Y'know, all these years, I thought you were on my side. But maybe what you were doing was sucking up to Mom and Dad so they'd keep liking you better!"
2228,"Hey, I married a lesbian to make you look good!"
2229,"You're right! I mean- you're right! It wasn't just the Weebles, but it was the Weeble Play Palace, and- and the Weebles' Cruise Ship. Oh, which had this little lifeboat for the Weebles to wobble in. "
2230,"That's tough. Tough stuff. C'mon, Pheebs, we're gonna catch that movie, we gotta get going. "
2231,"Oh, okay. Feel better, Rachel, 'kay?"
2232,"Geez, we're gonna be late, sweetie..."
2233,"Oh, okay. Listen, thanks for everything, Mon."
2234,You're welcome.
2235,"Listen guys, it was great seeing you again. Mon, um, easy on those cookies, okay? Remember, they're just food, they're not love."
2236,Hate that guy! 
2237,"Night, you guys."
2238,"Oh look, it's the woman we ordered."
2239,"Hey. Can, uh, can we help you?"
2240,"Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for, uh, Joey Tribbiani."
2241,I'm Joey Tribbiani.
2242,"Oh no, not you, big Joey. Oh my God, you're so much cuter than your pictures!  I-I'm, I'm Ronni....Cheese Nip?"
2243,"Uh, Joey's having an embolism, but I'd go for a Nip, y'know?"
2244,"Now, y'see, most people, when their pets pass on, they want 'em sorta laid out like they're sleeping. But occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose. Like, chasing their tail,  or, uh, jumping to catch a frisbee."
2245,"Joey, if I go first, I wanna be looking for my keys."
2246,That's a good one!
2247,"Hey, Joe."
2248,"Dad, Ronni's here."
2249,Huh?
2251,"Hey! Hello, babe! Wh- what're- what're you doing here?"
2252,"Oh, uh, well, you left your good hair at my apartment, I figured you'd need it tomorrow for your meeting. "
2253,Thank you. Uh...
2254,"So, who's up for a big game of Kerplunk?"
2255,"Look, I uh, I shouldn'ta come. I-I'd better get going, I don't wanna miss the last train."
2256,I don't want you taking that thing.
2257,"Oh, where'm I gonna stay, here?"
2258,Whoah-ho.
2259,We'll go to a hotel.
2261,No you won't.
2262,No we won't.
2263,If you go to a hotel you'll be.. doing stuff. I want you right here where I can keep an eye on you.
2264,You're gonna keep an eye on us?
2265,"That's right, mister, and I don't care how old you are, as long as you're under my roof you're gonna live by my rules. And that means no sleeping with your girlfriend."
2266,Wow. He's strict.
2267,"Now dad, you'll be in my room, Ronni- uh, you can stay in Chandler's room."
2268,"Thanks. You're, uh, you're a good kid."
2269,"C'mon, I'll show you to my room. ...That sounds so weird when it's not followed by 'No thanks, it's late'. "
2270,"Okay. Now this is just for tonight. Starting tomorrow, you gotta make a change. This has gone on long enough."
2271,What kinda change?
2272,"Well, either you break it off with Ronni-"
2273,I can't do that!
2274,Then you gotta come clean with Ma! This is not right!
2275,"Yeah, but this is-"
2276,I don't wanna hear it! Now go to my room!
2277,"Hey, Kicky. What're you doing?"
2278,Just trying to get comfortable. I can't sleep in my underwear. 
2279,"Well, you're gonna."
2280,"I've been thinking. Y'know, about how I'm always seeing girls on top of girls..."
2281,"Are they end to end, or tall like pancakes?"
2282,"Y'know what I mean, about how I'm always going out with all these women. And I always figured, when the right one comes along, I'd be able to be a stand-up guy and go the distance, y'know? Now I'm looking at my dad, thinking..."
2283,"Hey, you're not him. You're you. When they were all over you to go into your father's pipe-fitting business, did you cave?"
2285,"No. You decided to go into the out-of-work actor business. Now that wasn't easy, but you did it! And I'd like to believe that when the right woman comes along, you will have the courage and the guts to say- 'No thanks, I'm married'."
2286,You really think so?
2287,Yeah. I really do.
2288,"Thanks, Chandler. "
2289,Get off!
2291,Hi...May I help you?
2292,"Yeah, uh, Joey said I could use your shower, since, uh, Chandler's in ours?"
2293,Okay...who are you?
2294,"Oh, I'm Ronni. Ronni Rappelano? The mistress?"
2295,"Oh, c'mon in."
2297,"Hi, I'm Rachel."
2299,Bathroom's up there.
2300,Great.
2301,"Hey, listen, Ronni, how long would you say Chandler's been in the shower?"
2302,"Oh, like, uh, five minutes?"
2303,"Perfect. Fasten your seatbelts, it's pee-pee time.  Hey, Mr. Trib. "
2304,"Hey. Morning, dear."
2305,Chandler Bing? It's time to see your thing.
2306,What's the matter with you?!
2307,I thought it was Chandler!
2308,What? What?
2309,You were supposed to be in there so I could see your thing!
2310,"Sorry, my- my thing was in there with me."
2312,Hey. 
2313,How's it going?
2314,Good. Oh oh! Roger's having a dinner thing and he wanted me to invite you guys.
2315,So what's going on?
2316,"Nothing, um, it's just, um... It's Roger. "
2317,"I dunno, there's just something about..."
2318,Basically we just feel that he's...
2319,We hate that guy.
2320,Yeah. Hate him.
2321,"We're sorry, Pheebs, we're sorry."
2322,"...No, we hate him."
2323,We're sorry.
2324,Ma! What're you doing here?
2325,I came to give you this  and this. 
2326,Oww! Big ring!
2327,"Why did you have to fill your father's head with all that garbage about making things right? Things were fine the way they were! There's chicken in there, put it away. For God's sake, Joey, really. "
2328,"Hold on, you-you knew?"
2329,"Of course I knew! Whaddyou think? Your father is no James Bond. You should've heard some of his cover stories. 'I'm sleeping over at my accountant's'- I mean, what is that? Please!"
2330,"So then- how could you- I mean, how could you?!-"
2331,"Do you remember how your father used to be? Always yelling, always yelling nothing made him happy, nothing made him happy, not that wood shop, not those stupid little ships in the bottle, nothing. Now he's happy! I mean, it's nice, he has a hobby."
2332,"Ma, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but... what the hell are you talking about?! I mean, what about you?"
2333,"Me? I'm fine. Look, honey, in an ideal world, there'd be no her, and your father would look like Sting. And I'll tell you something else. Ever since that poodle-stuffer came along, he's been so ashamed of himself that he's been more attentive, he's been more loving... I mean, it's like every day's our anniversary."
2334,I'm...happy...for you?
2335,"Well don't be, because now everything's screwed up. I just want it the way it was."
2336,"Ma, I'm sorry. I just did what I thought you'd want."
2337,"I know you did, cookie. Oh, I know you did. So tell me. Did you see her?"
2338,Yeah. You're ten times prettier than she is.
2339,That's sweet. Could I take her?
2340,With this ring? No contest.
2341,"What's wrong, sweetie?"
2342,"Nothing, nothing."
2343,"Aaaah, what's wrong, c'mon. "
2344,"It's, I mean, it's nothing, I'm fine. It's my friends. They-they have a liking problem with you. In that, um, they don't."
2345,Oh. They don't.
2346,But they don't see all the wonderfulness that I see. They don't see all the good stuff and all the sweet stuff. They just think you're a little...
2348,Intense and creepy. 
2350,"But I don't. Me, Phoebe."
2351,"Well, I'm not- I'm not at all surprised they feel that way."
2352,"You're not? See, that's why you're so great! "
2353,"Actually it's, it's quite, y'know, typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic. Y'know, this kind of co-dependant, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which, I'm sorry, might as well have nipples on them, and you're like all 'Oh, define me! Define me! Love me, I need love!'."
2354,"So you talked to your dad, huh."
2355,"Yeah. He's gonna keep cheating on my ma like she wanted, she's gonna keep pretending she doesn't know even though she does, and my little sister Tina can't see her husband any more because he got a restraining order...which has nothing to do with anything except that I found out today."
2357,Things sure have changed here on Waltons mountain.
2358,"So Joey, you okay?"
2359,"Yeah, I guess. It's just- parents, after a certain point, you gotta let go. Even if you know better, you've gotta let them make their own mistakes."
2360,"Just think, in a couple of years we get to turn into them."
2361,"If I turn into my parents, I'll either be an alcoholic blond chasing after twenty-year-old boys, or... I'll end up like my mom."
2365,"Oh, okay, except I broke up with Roger."
2366,Awww.
2367,"Yeah, right."
2368,Aaawwwwww!!
2369,What happened?
2370,"I don't know, I mean, he's a good person, and he can be really sweet, and in some ways I think he is so right for me, it's just... I hate that guy!"
2371,"Hey, Joey. What's going on?"
2372,Clear the tracks for the boobie payback express. Next stop: Rachel Green. 
2373,Joey!! What the hell were you doing?!
2374,Sorry. Wrong boobies.
2375,"Hello, Joey."
2376,"Oh! ...Hello, dear. "
2377,"I'm tellin' you Ross, she wants you."
2378,She barely knows me. We just live in the same building.
2379,Any contact?
2380,She lent me an egg once.
2381,You're in!
2382,"Aw, right."
2383,"Hi, Ross."
2385,"Come on, Ross, you gotta get back in the game here, ok? The Rachel thing's not happening, your ex-wife is a lesbian--I don't think we need a third..."
2386,"Excuse me, could we get an egg over here, still in the shell? Thanks."
2387,An egg?
2388,"Yeah, you're gonna go up to her and say, ""Here's your egg back, I'm returning your egg."""
2389,I think it's winning.
2390,I think it's insane.
2391,"She'll love it. Go with the egg, my friend."
2392,Think it'll work?
2393,"No, it's su1c1de. The man's got an egg."
2394,You can not do this.
2395,"Do what, do what?"
2396,Roger wants to take her out tomorrow night.
2397,No! Phoebes! Don't you remember why you dumped the guy?
2398,"'Cause he was creepy, and mean, and a little frightening... alright, still, it's nice to have a date on Valentine's Day!"
2399,"But Phoebe, you can go out with a creepy guy any night of the year. I know I do."
2400,"Well, what are you guys doing tomorrow night?"
2401,"Actually, tomorrow night kinda depends on how tonight goes."
2402,"Oh, uh, listen, about tonight..."
2403,"No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend."
2404,"Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a--"
2405,"Pathetic mess? I know, but--come on, man, she's needy, she's vulnerable. I'm thinkin', cha-ching!  Thanks. Look, you have not been out with a woman since Janice. You're doin' this."
2406,Hi. She said yes.
2407,"Yes! Way to go, man!  Still got the egg, huh?"
2408,How do I look?
2409,"Oh, uh, I... don't... care.  Ok, now, remember, no trading. You get the pretty one, I get the mess."
2410,"Hi, Joey. Well well, look what you brought. Very nice."
2411,...And what did you bring?
2412,"She's checking the coats. Joey, I'm gonna go wash the cab smell off my hands. Will you get me a white Zinfandel, and a glass of red for Janice."
2413,Janice?
2414,Oh.... my.... God.
2415,"Hey, it's Janice."
2416,"Ok, I'm makin' a break for it, I'm goin' out the window."
2417,"No, no, no, don't! I've been waitin' for like, forever to go out with Lorraine. Just calm down. CHANDLER: Calm down? Calm down? You set me up with the woman that I've dumped twice in the last five months!"
2418,"Can you stop yellin'? You're makin' me nervous, and I can't go when I'm nervous."
2419,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you're right.  Come on, do it, do it, go, come on!!!"
2420,"Ok, ok, Roger was creepy, but he was nothing compared to Pete Carney."
2421,Which one was Pete Carney?
2422,"Pete the Weeper? Remember that guy who used to cry every time we had sex.  ""Was it good for you?"""
2423,"Yeah, well, I'll take a little crying any day over Howard-the-""I-win""-guy.  ""I win! I win!"" I went out with the guy for two months--I didn't get to win once."
2424,How did we end up with these jerks? We're good people!
2425,I don't know. Maybe we're some kinda magnets.
2426,I know I am. That's why I can't wear a digital watch.
2427,"There's more beer, right?"
2428,"Oh! You know my friend Abby who shaves her head? She said that if you want to break the bad boyfriend cycle, you can do like a cleansing ritual."
2429,"Phoebes, this woman is voluntarily bald."
2430,"Yeah. So, we can do it tomorrow night, you guys. It's Valentine's Day. It's perfect."
2431,"Ok, well, what kind of ritual?"
2432,"Ok. We can, um, we can burn the stuff they gave us."
2433,Or?
2434,"Or...or we can chant and dance around naked, you know, with sticks."
2435,Burning's good.
2436,"Burning's good. Yeah, I got stuff to burn."
2437,"You know, ever since I was little, I've been able to pick up quarters with my toes."
2438,"Good for you.  Uh, quarters or rolls of quarters?"
2439,"By the way, Chandler. I cut you out of all my pictures. So if you want, I have a bag with just your heads."
2440,That's OK.
2441,"Oh, are you sure? Really? Because you know, you could make little puppets out of them, and you could use them in your theater of cruelty."
2442,We can't do that.
2443,What? What can't you do?
2444,"Uh, can I talk to you for a second, over there?"
2445,"Uh, we might be leaving now."
2446,"Tell me it's ""you and me"" we."
2447,"She said she wants to slather my body with stuff and then lick it off. I'm not even sure what slathering is, but I definitely want to be a part of it."
2448,"Ok, you can not do this to me."
2449,"You're right, I'm sorry. You're right."
2450,"Uh, can we have three chocolate mousses to go please?"
2451,"I'm outta here. Here's my credit card. Dinner's on me. I'm sorry, Chandler."
2452,I hope she throws up on you.
2453,So...
2454,Just us.
2455,"Oh, what a crappy night!"
2456,"Although, I have enjoyed the fact that, uh your shirt's been stickin' outta your zipper ever since you came back from the bathroom."
2457,Excuse me.  How ya doin'?
2458,"So, do we have the best friends or what?"
2459,Joey's not a friend. He's...a stupid man who left us his credit card. Another drink? Some dessert? A big screen TV?
2460,I will go for that drink.
2461,You got it. Good woman!  Could we get a bottle of your most overpriced champagne?
2462,Each.
2463,"That's right, each. Oh, and a uh Rob Roy.  I've always wanted to know..."
2464,Happy Valentine's Day!
2465,"Oh, I miss you already. Can you believe this happened?"
2466,"No... no! And yet it did. Good-bye, Janice."
2467,Kiss me!
2468,"Oh, Chandler, sorry."
2469,"Ohhh, Chandler, sorry! Hey, Janice."
2470,"Hi, Monica."
2471,"Ok, well, this was very special."
2472,"Rache, come see who's out here!"
2473,"Oh my god. Janice, hi!"
2474,Janice is gonna go away now.
2475,I'll be right back.
2476,"Oh, Joey, look who it is."
2477,Whoa.
2478,"Oh, good, Joey's home now."
2479,This is so fun. This is like a reunion in the hall.
2480,"Oh, hi, Ross. Yeah. There's someone I want you to say hi to.  He just happened to call."
2481,"Hi, Ross. Yes, it's me. How did you know? "
2482,"I'm just sayin' if dogs do experience jet lag, then, because of the whole um, seven dog years to one human year thing, then, when a dog flies from New York to Los Angeles, he doesn't just lose three hours, he loses like a week and a half."
2483,That's funny. Who are they?
2484,"The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend."
2485,You mean they're lovers.
2486,If you wanna put a label on it.
2487,"Wow, uh, anything else I should know?"
2488,"Nope, nope, that's it."
2489,"Oh, and she's pregnant with my baby. I always forget that part.  Helloo!"
2490,"Ok, so now we need, um sage branches and the sacramental wine."
2491,"All I have is, is oregano and a Fresca."
2492,"Um, that's ok!  Ok. All right. Now we need the semen of a righteous man."
2493,"Ok, Pheebs, you know what, if we had that, we wouldn't be doing the ritual in the first place."
2494,Can we just start throwing things in?
2495,"Ok, yeah, ok.  Oh, OK."
2496,"Ok, Barry's letters. Adam Ritter's boxer shorts."
2497,"Ok, and I have the, uh receipt for my dinner with Nokululu Oon Ah Ah."
2498,"Look, here's a picture of Scotty Jared naked."
2499,Hey he's wearing a sweater.
2502,And here we have the last of Paulo's grappa.
2503,"Hey, Rachel, isn't that stuff almost pure--"
2504,How can I dump this woman on Valentine's day?
2505,I don't know. You dumped her on New Year's.
2506,"Oh, man. In my next life, I'm coming back as a toilet brush."
2507,"Hello, funny Valentine."
2508,"Hi, Just Janice."
2509,"Hello, Joey, our little matchmaker. I could just kiss you all over, and I'm gonna!"
2510,"If you don't do it, I will."
2511,"So, um, what do you do for a living?"
2512,"Well, um, for the past few years I've been working.....which is funny because, that wasn't even my major."
2513,Oh no. I thought you said they could sh**t the spot without you. SUSAN: I thought they could...I'll try to get back as soon as I can. I'm sorry. 
2514,"Now that is funny. Hey, do you think...would it be too weird if I invited Carol over to join us? 'Cause she's, she's alone now, and pregnant, and, and sad."
2515,I guess.
2516,Are you sure? Great. Carol? Wanna come over and join us?
2517,"Oh, no no no. I'm fine. I'm fine."
2518,"Come on. These people'll scooch down. You guys'll scooch, won't you? Let's try scooching! Come on. Come on. Uh, Kristen Riggs, this is Carol Willick. Carol, Kristin. Uh, Carol teaches sixth grade. And, Kristin, Kristin......does something that, funnily enough, wasn't even her major!"
2519,What do we got there?
2520,"A piece of something: boxer shorts, greeting cards, and what looks like a half-charred picture--Wow, that guy's hairier than the Chief!"
2521,"You know, it's a really funny story how this happened."
2522,It's all right. It's all right. You don't have to explain. This isn't the first boyfriend bonfire that we've seen get out of control.
2523,You're our third call tonight.
2525,"Oh, sure, Valentine's is our busiest night of the year."
2526,I brought you something.
2527,"Is it loaded? Oh, little candy hearts.  Chan and Jan Forever."
2528,I had them made special.
2529,"Ok, Janice. Janice. Hey, Janice. Look, there's no way for me to tell you this. At least there's no new way for me to tell you this. I just don't things are gonna work out."
2530,That's fine.
2531,It is?
2532,Mmm-hmm. Because I know that this isn't the end.
2533,"Oh no, you see, actually it is."
2534,"No, it isn't, because you won't let that happen. Don't you know it yet? You love me, Chandler Bing."
2535,"Oh, no I don't."
2536,Well then ask yourself this. Why do you think we keep ending up together? New Year's? Who invited who? Valentine's? Who asked who into whose bed?
2537,"I did, but--"
2538,"You seek me out. Something deep in your soul calls out to me like a foghorn. Janice, Janice. You want me. You need me. You can't live without me. And you know it. You just don't know you know it. See ya."
2539,Call me!
2540,It's not true. I never called your mother a wolverine.
2541,"You did so. I swear, I swear-- How long has she been in the bathroom?"
2542,"Uh, I don't think she's in the bathroom. Her coat is gone."
2543,Well maybe it's cold in there. Or maybe I screwed up the first date I had in 9 years.
2544,That could be it.
2545,"Oh, god.  You know, this is still pretty hot. "
2546,"Mushroom. Smile. They won't all be like this. Some women might even stay through dinner. Sorry, that's not funny"
2547,"No, it's just...you know the whole ""getting on with your life"" thing. Well, do I have to? I mean, I'm sitting here with this cute woman, and, and, and she's perfectly nice, and, but that there's, that's it. And um, and then I'm here talkin' to you, and, and it's easy, and it's fun, and, and I don't, I don't have to...You know, here's a wacky thought. Um, what's say you and I give it another sh*t? No no no, I know what you're gonna say, you're a lesbian. But what do you say we just put that aside for now you know? Let's just stick a pin in it, ok? Because, we're great together, you know. You can't deny it. Besides, you're carrying my baby. I mean, how perfect is that? But see, you know, you keep sayin' that, but there's somethin' right here. I love you."
2548,"Oh, I love you too. But--"
2549,"No but, no but."
2550,"You know that thing you put over here with the pin in it? It's time to take the pin out. You'll find someone, I know you will. The right woman is just waiting for you."
2551,"That's easy for you to say, you found one already."
2552,All you need is a woman who likes men and you'll be set.
2553,Not her.
2554,"We get off around midnight, why don't we pick you up then?"
2555,"So, um, will you bring the truck?"
2556,I'll even let you ring the bell.
2557,"Oh, my god."
2558,"See, there you go, the cleansing works!"
2559,They're nice guys.
2560,"Oh, they're firemen guys."
2561,You guys tell them you were married?
2563,"Are you kidding? My girlfriend doesn't know, I'm not gonna tell them!"
2564,"Rach, why does my swizzel stick have an eraser?"
2565,Oh! That's why. I'm sorry!
2566,Chandler.
2567,"Ms. Tedlock. You're looking lovely today. And may I say, that is a very flattering sleeve length on you."
2568,"Yeah. Well, Mr. Kostelick wants you to stop by his office at the end of the day."
2569,"Oh, listen. If this is about those prank memos, I had nothing to do with them. Really. Nothing at all. Really."
2570,"Hey guys, guys! Chandler's coming and he says he has, like, this incredible news, so when he gets here, we could all act like, you know..."
2573,Never mind. But it was going to be really good.
2576,"So, it's a typical day at work. I'm putting in my numbers, and then big Al calls me into his office and tells me he wants to make me processing supervisor."
2577,That's great!
2578,So.... I quit.
2580,Why? This was supposed to be a temp job!
2581,"Uh, Chandler... you've been there for five years."
2582,"If I took this promotion, it'd be like admitting that this is what I actually do."
2583,So was it a lot more money?
2584,It doesn't matter. I just don't want to be one of those guys that's in his office until twelve o'clock at night worrying about the WENUS.
2585,... the WENUS?
2586,Weekly Estimated Net Usage Systems. A processing term.
2587,Oh. That WENUS.
2588,So what're you going to do?
2589,I don't know. That's the thing. I don't know what I want to do. I just know I'm not going to figure it out working there.
2590,"Oooh! I have something you can do! I have this new massage client... Steve?  Anyway, he's opening up a restaurant and he's looking for a head chef."
2591,Um... hi there.
2592,"Hi!  Oh, yeah, no, I know. You're a chef. I know, and I thought of you first, but um, Chandler's the one who needs a job right now, so...."
2593,Yeah... I just don't have that much cheffing experience. Unless it's an all-toast restaurant.
2594,"Yeah, yeah! Well, what kind of food is he looking for?"
2595,"Well, he wants to do some ecclectic, so he's looking for someone who can, you know, create the entire menu."
2597,"Yeah, I know!  Well, what do you think?"
2598,"Thanks, Phoeb. But I just don't see myself in a big white hat."
2599,OK.  Hey Monica! Guess what!
2600,Can you see my nipples through this shirt?
2601,"No. But don't worry, I'm sure they're still there."
2602,"Where are you going, Mr. Suity-Man?"
2603,"Well, I have an appointment to see Dr. Robert Pillman, career counselor a-gogo.  I added the ""a-gogo""."
2604,Work counselor?
2605,"Hey, you guys all know what you want to do."
2606,I don't!
2607,"Hey, you guys in the living room all know what you want to do. You know, you have goals. You have dreams. I don't have a dream."
2608,"Ah, the lesser-known ""I don't have a dream"" speech."
2609,"Oh, I love my life, I love my life!"
2610,Ooh! Brian's Song!
2611,The meeting with the guy went great?
2612,"So great! He showed me where the restaurant's going to be. It's this cute little place on 10th Street. Not too big, not too small. Just right."
2613,Was it formerly owned by a blonde woman and some bears?
2614,"So anyway, I'm cooking dinner for him Monday night. You know, kind of like an audition. And Phoebe, he really wants you to be here, which will be great for me because you can 'ooh' and 'ahh' and make yummy noises."
2615,What are you going to make?
2616,Yummy noises.
2617,"And Monica, what are you going to make?"
2618,I don't know. I don't know. It's just going to be so great!
2619,"Ooh! I know what you could make!  I know! Oh, you should definitely make that thing... you know, with the stuff? You know, that thing... with the stuff...? OK, I don't know. "
2620,"Hey guys, does anybody know a good date place in the neighborhood?"
2621,"How about Tony's? If you can finish a 32-ounce steak, it's free."
2622,"OK, ahem, hey, does anybody know a good place if you're not dating a puma?"
2623,Who are you going out with?
2624,"Oh, is this the bug lady?"
2625,"Bzzzz.... I love you, Ross."
2626,Her name is Celia. She's not a bug lady. She's curator of insects at the museum.
2627,So what are you guys going to do?
2628,"Oh, I just thought we could go out to dinner, and then maybe bring her back to my place and I might introduce her to my monkey."
2629,And he's not speaking metaphorically.
2630,"So.... back to your place...you thinking, maybe...  huh-huh?"
2631,"Well, I don't know....  huh-huh.... but I'm hoping  huh-huh."
2632,"I'm telling you, that monkey is a chick magnet! She's going to take one look at his furry, cute little face and it'll seal the deal."
2633,"He's not going to hurt you! Keep going, Celia. Marcel..."
2634,I can't stand this! He's got his claws in my...
2635,Alright... 
2636,"OK, try this salmon mousse."
2637,Mmmm. Good.
2638,Is it better than the other salmon mousse?
2639,It's creamier.
2640,"Yeah, well, is that better?"
2641,"I don't know. We're talking about whipped fish, Monica. I'm just happy I'm keeping it down, y'know?"
2642,My God! What happened to you?
2643,"Eight and a half hours of aptitude tests, intelligence tests, personality tests... and what do I learn?  ""You are ideally suited for a career in data processing for a large multinational corporation."""
2644,That's so great! 'Cause you already know how to do that!
2645,"Can you believe it? I mean, don't I seem like somebody who should be doing something really cool? You know, I just always pictured myself doing... something."
2646,"Oh Chandler, I know, I know... oh, hey! You can see your nipples through this shirt!"
2647,"Hey, maybe this'll cheer you up."
2648,"Ooh, you know, I had a grape about five hours ago, so I'd better split this with you."
2649,It's supposed to be that small. It's a pre-appetizer. The French call it an amouz-bouche.
2650,Well.... it is amouz-ing...
2651,"Hello? Oh, hi Wendy! Yeah, eight o'clock. What did we say? Ten dollars an hour?... OK, great. All right, I'll see you then. Bye. "
2652,Ten dollars an hour for what?
2653,"Oh, I asked one of the waitresses at work if she'd help me out."
2655,Uh-oh.
2656,Well... of course I thought of you! But... but...
2657,"But, but?"
2658,"But, you see, it's just... this night has to go just perfect, you know? And, well, Wendy's more of a... professional waitress."
2659,Oh! I see. And I've sort of been maintaining my amateur status so that I can waitress in the Olympics.
2660,"You know, I don't mean to brag, but I waited tables at Innsbruck in '76.  Amouz-bouche? "
2661,Talk to me.
2662,"OK.... um, a weird thing happened to me on the train this morning..."
2663,No no no. Talk... dirty.
2664,"Wha... what, here?"
2665,Yes...
2666,Ah....
2667,Say something..... hot.
2668,Er.... um.....
2670,Um... uh.... vulva.
2671,Vulva?
2672,"Alright, I panicked, alright? She took me by surprise. You know, but it wasn't a total loss. I mean, we ended up cuddling."
2673,Whoaa!! You cuddled? How many times??
2674,"Shut up! It was nice. I just... I don't think I'm the dirty-talking kind of guy, you know?"
2675,What's the big deal? You just say what you want to do to her. Or what you want her to do to you. Or what you think other people might be doing to each other. I'll tell you what. Just try something on me.
2676,Please be kidding.
2677,Why not? Come on! Close your eyes and tell me what you'd like to be doing right now.
2678,OK.  I'm in my apartment...
2679,....yeah... what else?
2680,"That's it. I'm in my apartment, you're not there, we're not having this conversation. "
2681,"Alright, look, I'll start, OK?"
2682,"Joey, please."
2683,"Come on. Come on. Alright, ready, look!  Oh... Ross.... you get me so hot. I want your lips on me now."
2685,"Alright, now you say something."
2686,I... ahem... I really don't think so.
2687,"Come on! You like this woman, right?"
2689,"You want to see her again, right?"
2691,"Well if you can't talk dirty to me, how're you going to talk dirty to her? Now tell me you want to caress my butt!"
2692,"OK, turn around.  I just don't want you staring at me when I'm doing this."
2693,"Alright, alright. I'm around. Go ahead."
2694,"Ahem... I want.... OK, I want to... feel your... hot, soft skin with my lips."
2695,There you go! Keep going. Keep going!
2696,"I, er..."
2697,I want to take my tongue... and...
2698,....and....
2699,Say it... say it!
2700,...run it all over your body until you're... trembling with... with...
2701,....with??
2702,Funny story!
2703,It's OK. It's OK. I was always rooting for you two kids to get together.
2704,"Hey Chandler, while you were sleeping that guy from your old job called again."
2705,Again?
2706,"And again, and again, and again...  Hello?  And again."
2707,"Hey Mr. Kostelic! How's life on the fifteenth floor?... Yeah, I miss you too. Yeah, it's a lot less satisfying to steal pens from your own home, you know?... Well, that's very generous... er, but look, this isn't about the money. I need something that's more than a job. I need something I can really care about.... And that's on top of the yearly bonus structure you mentioned earlier?... Look, Al, Al... I'm not playing hardball here, OK? This is not a negotiation, this is a rejection!.... No! No! No, stop saying numbers! I'm telling you, you've got the wrong guy! You've got the wrong guy! I'll see you on Monday! "
2708,Well?
2709,"Wow! It's huge! It's so much bigger than the cubicle. Oh, this is a cube."
2710,Look at this! 
2711,Oh! You have a window!
2712,Yes indeedy!  With a beautiful view of...
2713,Oh look! That guy's peeing!
2714,"OK, that's enough of the view. Check this out, look at this. Sit down, sit down."
2716,"This is great!  Helen, could you come in here for a moment?"
2717,"Thank you Helen, that'll be all."
2718,"Last time I do that, I promise."
2719,"Wendy, we had a deal! Yeah, you promised! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! "
2720,Who was that?
2721,Wendy bailed. I have no waitress.
2722,Oh... that's too bad. Bye bye. 
2723,Ten dollars an hour.
2725,Twelve dollars an hour.
2726,"Mon. I wish I could, but I've made plans to walk around."
2727,"You know, Rachel, when you ran out of your wedding, I was there for you. I put a roof over your head, and if that means nothing to you...  twenty dollars an hour."
2728,Done.
2729,Well hello! Welcome to Monica's. May I take your coat?
2730,Hi Steve!
2731,"Hello, Monica.  Hello, greeter girl."
2732,This is Rachel.
2733,"Yeah, OK."
2734,"Mmmmmm! Everything smells so delicious! You know, I can't remember a time I smelt such a delicious combination of  of, OK, smells."
2735,It's a lovely apartment.
2736,"Oh, thank you. Would you like a tour?"
2737,"I was just being polite, but, alright."
2738,What's up?
2739,"In the cab, on the way over, Steve blazed up a doobie."
2741,"Smoked a joint? You know, lit a bone? Weed? Hemp? Ganja?"
2742,"OK, OK. I'm with you, Cheech. OK."
2743,Is it dry in here? 
2744,No. Let me get you some wine!
2745,"Yeah, I think we're ready for our first course.  OK, um, these are rot-shrimp ravioli, and celantro pondou sauce... ... with just a touch of mints... and... ... ginger."
2746,"Well, slap my ass and call me Judy! These are fantastic!"
2747,I'm so glad you liked them!
2748,Like 'em? I could eat a hundred of them!
2749,"Oh, well... um, that's all there are of those. But in about eight and a half minutes, we'll be serving some delicious onion tartlets."
2750,Tartlets. Tartlets. Tartlets. The word has lost all meaning. 
2751,Excuse me? Can I help you with anything?
2752,"You know, I don't know what I'm looking for."
2753,"Ah, cool! Taco shells! You know, these are... they're like a little corn envelope."
2754,You know that? You don't want to spoil your appetite.
2755,Hey! Sugar-O's! 
2756,"You know, if you just wait another... six and a half minutes..."
2757,Macaroni and cheese! We gotta make this!
2758,"No, we don't. "
2759,"Oh, OK.  Oh, sorry. "
2760,Why don't you just have a seat here?  OK... give me the Gummi-bears.
2762,Give them to me.
2763,"Alright, we'll share."
2764,"No, give me the..."
2765,Well then you can't have any.  Man overboard! I think he's drowning.  Hey fellows! Grab on a Sugar-O... save yourself!
2766,That's it! Dinner is over!
2770,"Why? It's just that I've waited seven years for an opportunity like this, and you can't even wait four and a half minutes for a stupid onion tartlet?"
2772,What a tool!
2773,You don't want to work for a guy like that.
2774,"I know... it's just... I thought this was, you know... it."
2775,"Look, you'll get there. You're an amazing chef."
2776,Yeah! You know all those yummy noises? I wasn't faking.
2777,"So, er... how did it go with Celia?"
2778,"Oh, I was unbelievable."
2779,"All right, Ross!"
2780,"I was the James Michener of dirty talk. It was the most elaborate filth you have ever heard. I mean, there were different characters, plot lines, themes, a motif... at one point there were villagers."
2781,Whoa! And the...  huh-huh?
2782,"Well, ahem... you know, by the time we'd finished with all the dirty talk, it was kinda late... and we were both kind of exhausted, so..."
2783,You cuddled.
2784,"Yeah, which was nice."
2785,You guys wanna try and catch a late movie or something?
2786,"Maybe, but shouldn't we wait for Chandler?"
2787,"Yeah, where the hell is he?"
2788,"Yes, Fran. I know what time it is, but I'm looking at the WENUS and I'm not happy!... Oh, really, really, really? Well, let me tell you something... you will care about it, because I care about it! You got it? Good!  Whooooaaaa...."
2789,How's this? 
2790,Eeeee!
2791,How about over here? 
2792,Aaaaah!
2793,"See, that just means it's working. Does this hurt? "
2795,What about this? 
2796,"This is unbelievable. It's been like a half an hour. If this was a cartoon, you'd be looking like a ham right about now."
2797,"There's the waitress. Excuse me, Miss. Hello, Miss?"
2798,It's Phoebe! Hi!
2799,"Hi. Ok, will that be all?"
2800,"Wait, wait! Wh-What are you doing here?"
2801,"Yeah, um, I was over there, and then you said ""excuse me, hello miss,"" so now I'm here."
2802,"No, no how come are you working here?"
2803,"Right, yeah, 'cause it's close to where I live, and the aprons are really cute."
2804,Can we start over?
2805,"Yeah. Ok, great. I'm gonna be over here."
2807,"I don't know whether he's testing me, or just acting out, but my monkey is out of control. But, he keeps erasing the messages on my machine, supposedly by accident."
2808,"Oh, yeah, I've done that."
2809,"And then, like three days in a row he got to the newspaper before I did and pee-ed all over the crossword."
2810,I've never done that.
2811,"All right, now look at her and tell me she doesn't look exactly like her sister."
2812,I'm sayin' I see a difference.
2813,They're twins!
2814,I don't care. Phoebe's Phoebe. Ursula's--hot!
2815,"You know that thing, when you and I talk to each other about things. Let's not do that anymore."
2816,"Hey Pheebs, guess who we saw today."
2817,"Ooh! Oh! Fun! Ok. Um, Liam Neeson."
2819,Morly Safer.
2821,The woman who cuts my hair!
2822,"Ok, look, this could be a really long game."
2823,Your sister Ursula.
2824,"Oh, really."
2825,"Yeah, yeah, she works over at that place, uh--"
2826,"Riff's. Yeah, I know."
2827,"Oh, you do? Because she said you guys haven't talked in like years."
2828,"Hmmm? Uh, yeah. So, uh, is she fat?"
2829,Not from where I was standin'.
2830,Where were you standing?
2831,"Um, Pheebs, so, you guys just don't get along?"
2832,"It's mostly just dumb sister stuff, you know, I mean, like, everyone always thought of her as the pretty one, you know. Oh, oh, she was the first one to start walking, even though I did it, later that same day. But, to my parents, by then it was like ""yeah, right, well what else is new""?"
2833,"Oh, Pheebs, I'm sorry, but I've got to go. I've got Lamaze class."
2834,"Oh, and I've got Earth Science, but I'll catch you in gym."
2835,"So, is this just gonna be you and Carol?"
2836,"No, Susan's gonna be there too. We've got dads, we've got lesbians, the whole parenting team."
2837,"Well, isn't that gonna be weird?"
2838,"No, no. I mean, it mighta been at first, but by now I, I think I'm pretty comfortable with the whole situation."
2839,"Ross, that's my jacket."
2841,"Hi, we're the Rostins. I'm J.C., and he's Michael, and we're having a boy, and a girl."
2842,Good for you. Next?
2843,"I'm Ross Geller, and that's, that's my boy in there, and uh, this is Carol Willick, and this is Susan Bunch. Susan is Carol's... Who's next?"
2844,"I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. Susan is Carol's--?"
2845,Susan is Carol's Carol's Carol's friend.
2846,Life partner.
2847,Like buddies.
2848,Like lovers.
2849,You know how close women can get.
2850,Susan and I live together.
2851,Although I was married to her.
2852,"Carol, not me."
2853,Right.
2854,It's a little complicated.
2855,A little.
2856,But we're fine.
2857,"Absolutely. So, twins. Huh, that's like two births. Ouch."
2858,"And  to you too, Helen."
2859,Nina Bookbinder is here to see you.
2860,"Oh, ok. Send her in."
2862,"Hi, Nina. Come on in."
2863,You wanted to see me?
2864,"Uh, Yes. Yes. I've just been going over your data here, and little thing, you've been post-dating your Friday numbers."
2865,Which is bad because--?
2866,"Well, it throws my WENUS out of whack."
2867,Your--Excuse me?
2868,WENUS. Weekly Estimated Net Usage Statistics.
2869,"Oh, right. Gotcha. It won't happen again. I wouldn't want to do anything to hurt your...WENUS."
2870,"It's not just that she's cute, ok. It's just that she's really really cute."
2871,It doesn't matter. You don't dip your pen in the company ink.
2872,"Ross, your little creature's got the remote again."
2873,"Marcel, Marcel, give Rossie the remote. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote right now. Marcel, you give Rossie the remote..."
2875,"Relax, I'll fix it."
2876,"Oh, cool. ""Urkel"" in Spanish is ""Urkel""."
2877,How did he do this?
2878,"So tell me something, is leaving the Christmas lights up part of your plan to keep us merry all year long?"
2879,"No, you see, someone was supposed to take them down around New Year's but obviously someone forgot."
2880,"Well someone was supposed to write ""Rache, take down the lights"" and put it on the refrigerator. How long has that been there?"
2881,"Hey, where you been?"
2882,"I went back to Riff's. I think Ursula likes me. All I ordered was coffee, and she brought me a tuna melt and four plates of curly fries."
2883,Score.
2884,She is so hot.
2885,"Yeah, listen. Before you do anything Joey-like, you might wanna run it by, uh--"
2886,Pheebs? You think it would be ok if I asked out your sister?
2887,Why? Why would you wanna do that? Why?
2888,"So that if we went out on a date, she'd be there."
2889,"Well, I mean, I'm not my sister's, you know, whatever, and uh, I mean, it's true, we were one egg, once, but you know, we've grown apart. So, uh, I don't know. Why not?"
2890,"Cool, thanks."
2891,You ok?
2892,Yeah I'm fine.
2893,You wanna watch Laverne y Shirley?
2894,Sorry. Hi. Sorry I'm late. Where's Carol?
2895,Stuck at school. Some parent-teacher thing. You can go. I'll get the information.
2896,"No, no, no. I think I should stay. I think we should both know what's going on."
2897,"Oh, good. This'll be fun."
2898,"All righty. We're gonna start with some basic first-stage breathing exercises, so Mommies, why don't you get on your backs, and coaches, you should be supporting Mommy's head."
2901,I am supposed to be the mommy?
2902,"Ok, I'm gonna play my sperm card one more time."
2903,"Look, I don't see why I should have to miss out on the coaching training just because I'm a woman."
2904,I see. So what do you propose to do?
2905,I will flip you for it.
2906,"Flip me for it? No, no, no--heads, heads!"
2907,"On your back, Mom."
2908,"All right, Mommies, take a nice deep cleansing breath. Good. Now imagine your vag*na is opening like a flower."
2909,"Mr. D, how's it going, sir??"
2910,It's been better. The Annual Net Usage Statistics are in.
2911,And?
2912,It's pretty ugly. We haven't seen an ANUS this bad since the seventies.
2913,So what does this mean?
2914,"Well, we're gonna be layin' off people in every department."
2915,"Hey, listen, I know I came in late last week, but I slept funny, and my hair was very very--"
2916,Not you. Relax. Ever have to fire anyone?
2917,Nina? Nina. Nina. Nina.
2918,Are you ok?
2919,"Yes, yes I am. Listen, the reason that I called you in here today is, uh, please don't hate me."
2921,Would you like to have dinner sometime?
2922,"So Pheebs, what do you want for your birthday?"
2923,"Well, what I really want is for my mom to be alive and enjoy it with me."
2924,Ok. Let me put it this way. Anything from Crabtree &amp; Evelyn?
2925,Ooh! Bath salts would be nice.
2926,What is this place?
2927,"Look, you're cold, I have to pee, and there's a cup of coffee on the window. How bad could it be?"
2928,I think we have an answer.
2929,What's she doing here?
2930,This could be God's way of telling us to eat at home.
2931,Think she got fired at Riff's?
2932,"No, no, no. We were there last night. She kept bringing swordfish. Are you gonna go--"
2933,"I'm gonna wait till after we order. It's her, right."
2934,"It looks like her. Um, excuse me."
2936,"Hi, it's us."
2937,"Right, and it's me."
2938,"So, so you're here too?"
2939,Much as you are.
2940,Your turn.
2941,We know what we want.
2942,"Oh, that's good."
2943,All we want is two cafe lattes.
2944,And some biscotti cookies.
2945,Good choice.
2946,Definitely her.
2948,I can't believe you. You still haven't told that girl she doesn't have a job yet?
2949,"Well, you still haven't taken down the Christmas lights."
2950,"Congratulations, I think you've found the world's thinnest argument."
2951,"I'm just trying to find the right moment, you know?"
2952,"Oh, well, that shouldn't be so hard, now that you're dating. Sweetheart, you're fired, but how 'bout a quickie before I go to work."
2954,"You know, once you're inside, you don't have to knock anymore."
2955,"I'll get it. Hi, Mr. Heckles."
2956,You're doing it again.
2957,"We're not doing anything. We're just sitting around talking, quietly."
2958,I can hear you through the ceiling. My cats can't sleep.
2959,You don't even have cats.
2960,I could have cats.
2961,Goodbye Mr. Heckles.
2962,We'll try to keep it down.
2963,"Phoebe, could you do me a favor? Could you try this on? I just wanna make sure it fits."
2964,"Oh, my first birthday present. Oh, this is really--"
2965,"Oh, no no no. It's for Ursula. I just figured, you know, size wise."
2966,"Oh, sure, yeah. Ok, it fits."
2967,Are you seein' her again tonight?
2968,Yep. Ice Capades.
2969,"Wow, this is serious. I've never known you to pay money for any kind of capade."
2970,"I don't know. I like her, you know. She's different. There's uh, somethin about her that--"
2971,That you like. We get it. You like her. Great.
2972,"Hey, Phoebe, I asked you and you said it was ok."
2973,"All right, well, maybe now it's not ok."
2974,"Ok, well maybe now I'm not ok with it not being ok."
2975,Ok.
2976,"Knit, good woman, knit, knit!"
2977,And that's the Chrysler building right there.
2978,Nina.
2979,Mr. Douglas. Cool tie.
2980,She's still here.
2981,"Yes, yes she is. Didn't I memo you on this? See, after I let her go, uh, I got a call from her psychiatrist, Dr. Fl---, Dr. Flanen, Dr. Flan, and uh, he informed me that uh, she took the news rather badly. In fact, he uh, mentioned the word ""frenzy""."
2982,You're kidding? She seems so--
2983,"Oh, no, no. Nina--she is whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo. In fact, if you asked her right now, she would have no recollection of being fired at all, none at all."
2984,That's unbelievable.
2985,"And yet, believable. So I decided not to fire her again until I can be assured that she will be no thr*at to herself or others."
2986,I see. I guess you never really know what's goin' on inside a person's head.
2987,"Well, I guess that's why they call it psychology, sir."
2988,Lights please? And that's having a baby. Next week is our last class.
2989,"Susan, go deep."
2990,This is impossible. It's just impossible.
2991,"What is, honey?"
2992,"What that woman did. I am not doin' that. It's just gonna have to stay in. That's all, everything will be the same, it'll just stay in."
2993,"Carol, honey, shhh, everything's gonna be all right."
2994,"What do you know? No one's come up to you and said, ""Hi, is that your nostril? Mind if we push this pot roast through it?"""
2995,"Carol, Carol, please. Cleansing breath. I know it's frightening, but, big picture. The birth part is just one day, and when it's over, we're all gonna be parents for the rest of our lives. I mean, that's what this is all about, right? Ross? Ross?"
2996,I'm gonna be a father.
2997,It's just occurring to you?
2998,"I always knew I was havin' a baby, I just never realized the baby was having me."
2999,"Oh, you're gonna be great!"
3000,"Aw, how can you say that? I can't even get Marcel to stop eating the bath mat. How am I gonna raise a kid?"
3001,"You know, Ross, some scientists are now saying that, that monkeys and babies are actually different."
3002,Where're you going?
3003,Out.
3004,With?
3005,Yes.
3006,"All right, could I just ask you one question? Have you two, you know...like, you know, you know, yet?"
3007,"Well, not that it's any of your business, but, no, we haven't, ok? You meant sex, right?"
3008,Do you have a sec?
3009,"Uh, sure, Nina. What's up?"
3010,"I don't know. For the past couple of days, people have been avoiding me and giving me these really strange looks."
3011,"Oh, well, uh, maybe that's because they're uh, jealous of us."
3012,Maybe. But that doesn't explain why they keep taking my scissors.
3013,"Uh, well, maybe that's, uh, because you're getting a big raise."
3014,I am?
3015,"Sure, why not?"
3016,Oh my god! You're amazing.
3017,"Oh, you don't know. Helen, would you make sure we put through the paperwork on Miss Bookbinder's raise?"
3018,Do you still want me to send her psychological profile to perosnnel?
3020,Helen drinks. Will you marry me?
3021,"Well, I ended up telling her everything."
3022,"Oh, how'd she take it?"
3023,"Pretty well. Except for the stapler thing. Little tip: If you're ever in a similar situation, never ever leave your hand on the desk."
3024,"Ok, I think I get how to do this."
3025,"All right, so, can we turn this off? Just, just make it--make them go away? I can't, I can't look."
3026,"Ok, Pheebs, they're gone. Are you all right?"
3027,"Yeah. Yeah. It's just, you know, it's this whole stupid Ursula thing."
3028,"Ok, Pheebs, can I ask? So, he's going out with her. I mean, is it really so terrible?"
3029,"Um, yeah. Look, I mean, I'm not saying she's like evil or anything. She just, you know, she's always breaking my stuff. When I was eight, and I wouldn't let her have my Judy Jetson thermos, so she threw it under the bus. Oh, and then there was Randy Brown, who was like, have you ever had a boyfriend who was like your best friend?"
3031,"Well, but that's what he was for me. And she you know, kind of stole him away, and then broke his heart, and then he wouldn't even talk to me anymore. Because he said he didn't wanna be around anything that looked like either one of us. I mean, I know Joey is not my boyfriend, or my thermos, or anything, but--"
3032,You're not gonna lose him.
3033,"Come on, you gotta talk to Joey."
3035,"Come on, he doesn't know this stuff. If he knew how you felt--"
3036,But he's falling in love with her.
3037,"Please, they've been going out a week. They haven't even slept together yet, I mean, that's not serious."
3038,"Ok. Oh, ok, oh."
3039,"Oh. Yeah, um, may we help you?"
3040,"Rachel, what are you doing? It's freezing out here. Would you come back inside?"
3041,"No no no no no. You wanted me to take them down, so I'm takin' 'em down. Ok? Whoa! "
3042,"I'm ok! I'm ok! Mr. Heckles, Mr. Heckles could you help me please?"
3043,"See, this is just the kind of thing I was talking about."
3044,Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow. Ow ow ow.
3045,"Hi. Uh, my friend here was taking down our Christmas lights, and she fell off the balcony and may have broken her foot or ankle or something."
3046,My god. You still have your Christmas lights up? Fill this out and bring it back to me.
3048,"All right. Name, address...Ok, in case of emergency call?"
3052,"Oh, that is so sweet. Oh gosh. I love you. Insurance?"
3053,"Oh, yeah, check it. Definitely, I want some of that. Monica: You don't have insurance?"
3054,"Why, how much is this gonna cost?"
3055,"I have no idea, but x-rays alone could be a couple hundred dollars."
3056,Well what are we gonna do?
3057,There's not much we can do.
3058,"Um, unless, unless I use yours."
3059,No no no no no no no no no.
3060,"Well, now, wait a second. Who did I just put as my ""In case of emergency"" call person?"
3061,That's insurance fraud.
3062,"Well, all right, then, forget it. Might as well just go home. Ow!"
3063,Ok. Ok. I hate this.
3064,Thank you. Thank you. I love you.
3065,"Hi. Um, I'm gonna need a new set of these forms."
3067,"I am really an idiot. You see, I was filling out my friend's forms, and instead of putting her information, I put mine."
3068,You are an idiot.
3069,"Yep, that's me. I am that stupid."
3070,I had a dream last night where I was playing football with my kid.
3071,That's nice.
3072,"No, no, with him. I'm on this field, and they, they hike me the baby. I know I've gotta do something 'cause the Tampa Bay defense is comin' right at me."
3073,Tampa Bay's got a terrible team.
3074,"Right, but, it is just me and the baby, so I'm thinkin' they can take us. And so I uh, I just heave it downfield."
3075,What are you crazy? That's a baby!
3076,He should take the sack?
3077,"Anyway, suddenly I'm downfield, and I realize that I'm the one who's supposed to catch him, right? Only I know there is no way I'm gonna get there in time, so I am running, and running, and that, that is when I woke up. See, I am so not ready to be a father."
3078,"Hey, you're gonna be fine. You're one of the most caring, most responsible men in North America. You're gonna make a great dad."
3079,"Yeah, Ross. You and the baby just need better blocking. Oh, have either one of you guys ever been to the Rainbow Room? Is it real expensive?"
3080,"Well, only if you order stuff."
3081,I'm takin' Ursula tonight. It's her birthday.
3082,Whoa. What about Phoebe's birthday?
3083,When's that?
3084,Tonight.
3085,"Oh, man. What're the odds of that happening?"
3086,You take your time.
3087,There it is! So what're you gonna do?
3088,"What can I do? Look, I don't want to do anything to screw it up with Ursula."
3089,And your friend Phoebe?
3090,"Well, if she's my friend, hopefully she'll understand. I mean, wouldn't you guys?"
3091,"Man if you tried something like that on my birthday, you'd be starin' at the business end of a hissy fit."
3092,"Ok, uh, Monica?"
3093,"Yes, yes she is."
3094,"Hi, this is my friend Rachel."
3096,"Hi, Rachel. I'm Dr. Mitchell."
3097,"And I'm his friend, Dr. Rosin."
3098,Aren't you a little cute to be a doctor?
3099,Excuse me?
3100,"I meant young, young, I meant young, young to be a doctor. Oh, Good Rach."
3103,"So, he said it was just a sprain, and that was it."
3104,"Uh, you left out the stupid part."
3105,"Not stupid. The very cute, cute, cute doctors asked us out for tomorrow night, and I said yes."
3106,"I think it's totally insane, I mean, they work for the hospital. It's like returning to the scene of the crime. I say we blow off the dates."
3107,"What? Monica, they are cute, they are doctors, cute doctors, doctors who are cute!"
3108,"All right, what have we learned so far?"
3109,Surprise!
3110,What the hell are you doing? You scared the crap outta me.
3111,Was that the cake?
3112,"Yeah, yeah. I got a lemon shmush."
3113,"Come on, she'll be here any minute."
3114,I hope it's ok.
3115,Happy birthday Peehee.
3116,"Well maybe we can make a ""b"" out of one of those roses."
3117,"Yeah, we'll just use our special cake tools."
3118,"Hey, what's going on?"
3120,"Oh, oh, oh! This is so great! Oh my god! This was not at all scary. Hi everybody. Hi Betty! Betty, hi! You found Betty! Oh my god! This is great. Everybody I love is in the same room. Where's Joey?"
3121,Did you see Betty?
3122,"I tell you one thing, I wouldn't mind having a piece of this sun-dried tomato business. Five years ago, if somebody had said to me, here's a tomato that looks like a prune, I'd 'a' said ""get out of my office!"""
3123,"Dad, before I was born, did you freak out at all?"
3124,"I'm not freaking out, I'm just saying, if somebody had come to me with the idea--"
3125,"Dad, dad, dad, I'm talkin' about the whole uh, baby thing. Did you uh, ever get this sort of panicky, ""Oh my god I'm gonna be a father"" kind of a thing?"
3126,No. Your mother really did the work. I was busy with the business. I wasn't around that much. Is that what this is about?
3127,"No, no, Dad, I was just wondering."
3128,'Cause there's time to make up for that. We can still do stuff together. You always wanted to go to that Colonial Williamsburg. How 'bout we do that?
3129,"Thanks, Dad. Really, you know, I just, I just needed to know, when did you start to feel like a father?"
3130,"Oh, well, I, I guess it musta been the day after you were born. We were in the hospital room, your mother was asleep, and they brought you in and gave you to me. You were this ugly little red thing, and all of a sudden you grabbed my finger with your whole fist. And you squeezed it, so tight. And that's when I knew. So you don't wanna go to Williamsburg?"
3131,"No, we can go to Williamsburg."
3132,Eat your fish.
3133,"Rachel, the cute doctors are here."
3134,"Ok, coming!"
3135,"Hi, come on in."
3136,"Here, we brought wine."
3137,"And this is from the cellars of Ernest and Tova Borgnine, so how could we resist?"
3138,"Oh, that's great. Look at that."
3139,"Monica, how's the ankle?"
3140,"It's uh, well, uh, why don't you tell them? After all, it is your ankle."
3141,"You know what, it's feeling a lot better, thank you. Well, listen, why don't you two sit down, and we'll get you some glasses....STAT."
3142,"Ok, listen, I'm thinking, why don't we just tell them who we really are. I mean, it'll be fine, I really think it'll be fine, I really do."
3143,It will not be fine. We'll get in trouble.
3144,Would you stop being such a wuss?
3145,"A wuss? Excuse me for living in the real world, ok?"
3147,"So, they still seem normal."
3148,That's because they are normal.
3149,"Ok, but you have to admit that every time we go out with women we meet at the hospital, it turns into--"
3150,"Would you relax? Look around. No pagan altars, no piles of bones in the corners, they're fine. Go like this."
3151,"I said we are not going to do it. Sometimes you can be such a, a big baby."
3152,I am not a baby. You know what?
3154,You know what?
3156,"Every day, you are becoming more and more like your mother."
3157,This is a great place. How long have you lived here?
3158,"I've been here about six years, and Rachel moved in a few months ago."
3159,"Yeah, I was supposed to get married, but, um, I left the guy at the altar. Yeah, I know it's pretty selfish, but hey, that's me. Why don't you try the hummus?"
3160,"So, Monica, what do you do?"
3161,"Uh, I'm a uh, chef at a restaurant uptown."
3162,Good for you.
3163,"Yeah it is. Mostly because I get to boss people around, which I just love to do."
3164,This hummus is great.
3165,God bless the chickpea.
3166,"Oh, God, I am so spoiled. That's it."
3167,"And by the way, have I mentioned that back in high school, I was a cow."
3168,I used to wet my bed.
3169,I use my breasts to get other people's attention.
3170,We both do that.
3171,"Monica and Rachel's apartment. Just a minute. Rachel, it's your dad."
3172,"Hi, Dad. No, no, it's me. Listen, Dad, I can't talk right now, um, but there's something, um, there's something that I've been meaning to tell you. Remember back in freshman year? Well, Billy Drestin and I had sex on your bed."
3173,"Daddy, daddy, why? Why would I sleep with Billy Drestin? His father tried to put you out of business! You are dead!"
3174,"Ross, he's got the remote again."
3175,Good. Maybe he can switch it back. Maybe not.
3176,"Hello? Uh, yeah, uh, hold on a second. Let me see if she's here. It's the woman from the hospital admissions office. Oh, god, what do we do, what do we do?"
3177,Find out what they want.
3178,"No, you do it."
3179,"Hello, this is Monica. Yeah? Oh, ok, yes, we'll be right down. Thank you."
3181,We forgot to sign one of the admissions forms.
3182,"You were right, this was just not worth it."
3184,"Ok, let me just change."
3187,Hi. Trouble?
3188,Your sister stood me up the other night.
3189,"Oh, no. Don't you just hate it when people aren't there for you?"
3190,Well did you try calling her?
3191,"I've been trying for two days. When I call the restaurant, they say she's too busy to talk. I can't believe she's blowin' me off."
3194,"Um, you, got a minute?"
3195,"Um, yeah, I'm just working."
3198,"Um, oh, I got you a birthday present."
3199,"Oh, wow! You remembered! Oh, it's a Judy Jetson thermos."
3200,"Right, like the kind you--"
3201,"Right. Oh, I got something for you too."
3202,How'd you know I was coming?
3203,"Um, yeah, um, twin thing."
3204,I can't believe you did this. I can't believe you--did this.
3205,"Oh, right. He is so great. But that's over."
3206,Does he know?
3208,"Joey. You know, um, he's really nutsy about you."
3209,He is? Why?
3210,You got me.
3211,Right. Excuse me. Doesn't this come with a side salad?
3212,"So, um, are you gonna call him?"
3213,"Why, do you think he likes me?"
3214,No. Joey.
3215,"Oh. No, no, he is so smart. He'll figure it out. Do you want some chicken?"
3216,No. No food with a face.
3217,You have not changed.
3218,"Yeah, you too."
3219,"Hi, remember us?"
3220,Mmm hmmm.
3221,"You just called a little while ago about needing a signature on an admissions form. Well, it turns out we need a whole new one because uh, you see, I, I put the wrong name again. 'Cause um..."
3222,You're that stupid.
3223,I am. I'm that stupid.
3224,And I'm just gonna pay for this with a check.
3225,You know your insurance will cover that.
3226,I know. I'm just not that bright either.
3227,"Ok, worst case scenario. Say you never feel like a father. Say your son never feels connected to you as one. Say all of his relationships are affected by this."
3228,Do you have a point?
3229,"You know, you'd think I would. What's up with the simian? ROSS: It's just a furball."
3230,"Ok, who's turn is it?"
3231,"Yours. I just got 43 points for ""kidney""."
3232,"No, no, you got zero points for ""idney""."
3233,"I had a ""k"". Where's my ""k""?"
3234,"You've got to help me! My monkey swallowed a ""k""!"
3235,You get that animal out of here.
3236,"No, you don't understand. The animal hospital is way across town. He's choking. I don't know what else to do."
3238,Marcel swallowed a Scrabble tile.
3239,Excuse me. This hospital is for people.
3240,"Lady, he is people. He has a name, ok? He watches Jeopardy. He touches himself when nobody's watching. Please, please, have a heart!"
3241,I'll take a look at him.
3242,"Oh, thank you."
3243,Michael.
3244,Rachel.
3246,Monica.
3251,"Urs, what're you doing here? I've been trying to call you."
3252,"Listen, um."
3253,"No, no, no, don't say ""listen"". I know that ""listen"". I've said that ""listen""."
3254,I'm sorry.
3255,I don't get it. What happened? What about everything you said under the bridge?
3256,"Yeah, um, you know, you should just forget about what I said under the bridge, I was talkin' crazy that night, I was so drunk."
3257,You don't drink
3258,Urs--
3259,"Ok, yeah, so it's not gonna work."
3260,Why? Is it because I'm friends with Phoebe?
3261,"If it was, would you stop hanging out with her?"
3262,"No. No, I, I couldn't do that."
3263,"Um, then yes, 'cause of Phoebe. So, you know, it's either her or me."
3264,"Then, uh, then I'm sorry."
3265,"You know, you're gonna be really, really hard to get over."
3266,"I know. I don't know whether it's just 'cause we're breakin' up or what, but you have never looked so beautiful."
3268,Pheebs?
3270,He looks so tiny.
3271,We just got the message.
3272,Is he all right?
3273,"Yeah. The doctor got the ""k"" out. He also found an ""m"" and an ""o""."
3274,"We think he was trying to spell out ""monkey""."
3275,"Well, the doctor says he's gonna be fine. He's just sleeping now."
3276,"So, you feel like a dad yet?"
3277,"No, why?"
3278,"Hey, come on, you came through, you did what you had to do. That is very dad."
3279,"Uh, Rach, we're running low on resumes over here."
3280,Do you really want a job with Popular Mechanics?
3281,"Well, if you're gonna work for mechanics, those are the ones to work for."
3282,"Hey, look, you guys, I'm going for anything here, OK? I cannot be a waitress anymore, I mean it. I'm sick of the lousy tips, I'm sick of being called 'Excuse me...'"
3283,"Rach, did you proofread these?"
3284,"Uh... yeah, why?"
3285,"Uh, nothing, I'm sure they'll be impressed with your excellent compuper skills."
3286,"Oh my Goood! Oh, do you think it's on all of them?"
3287,"Oh no, I'm sure the Xerox machine caught a few."
3288,"Hey, guys."
3290,"Hey... hi, ladies... uh, can I get you anything? : Did you bring the mail?"
3291,Lots of responses.
3292,": Really? : Sure, we have scones left! : OK, read them to me."
3293,": Dear Ms. Green, thank you for your inquiry, however... oh... "
3294,: We have apple cinnamon...
3295,: OK... Dear Ms. Green... yeah... yeah... yeah... No. 
3296,Wow!
3298,: Your Visa bill is huge!
3299,Give me that!
3300,"You know, I can't believe you. Linda is so great! Why won't you go out with her again?"
3301,I don't know.
3302,Is this still about her whole 'The Flintstones could've really happened' thing?
3303,"No, it's not just that. It's just--I want someone who... who does something for me, y'know? Who gets my heart pounding, who... who makes me, uh... "
3304,...little playthings with yarn?
3306,Could you want her more?
3308,"Dee, the sarcastic sister from Whats Happening."
3309,"Look, I am totally, totally over her, OK, I just... : Hiiii!"
3310,Hi! How are you?
3311,"We're fine, we're fine."
3314,We're not--we're not saying anything.
3316,Uhhhh... Joey cried last night.
3318,"We were playing poker, alright..."
3319,"There was chocolate on the three. It looked like an eight, alright?"
3320,"Oh, guys, you should've seen him. 'Read 'em and weep.'"
3321,And then he did.
3322,"Well, now, how come you guys have never played poker with us?"
3323,"Yeah, what is that? Like, some kind of guy thing? Like, some kind of sexist guy thing? Like it's poker, so only guys can play?"
3324,"No, women are welcome to play."
3325,"Oh, OK, so then what is it? Some kind of... you know, like, like... some kind of, y'know, like... alright, what is it?"
3326,There just don't happen to be any women in our games.
3327,"Yeah, we just don't happen to know any women that know how to play poker."
3328,"Oh, yeah, right."
3329,"Oh, please, that is such a lame excuse!"
3331,"I mean, that's a typical guy response."
3332,"Excuse me, do any of you know how to play?"
3334,But you could teach us.
3336,"OK, so now we draw cards."
3337,"So I wouldn't need any, right? Cause I have a straight."
3338,"Oh, good for you!"
3339,Congratulations!
3340,"OK Phoebs, how many do you want?"
3341,"OK, I just need two... the, um, ten of spades and the six of clubs."
3342,"No. No, uh, Phoebs? You can't--you can't do--"
3343,"Oh wait, I have the ten of spades! Here!  Ross: No, no. Uh... no, see, uh, you-you can't do that."
3344,"Oh, no no no no no no, that's OK, I don't need them. I'm going for fours."
3345,"Oh, you're... "
3346,"Alright, here we go. We've got salmon roulettes and assorted crudites."
3347,OOooooo!
3348,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, Monica, what're you doin'? This is a poker game. You can't serve food with more than one syllable. It's gotta be like chips, or dip, or pretz--"
3349,"OK, so at this point, the dealer--"
3350,"Alright, you know, we got it, we got it. Let's play for real. High stakes... big bucks..."
3351,"Alright, now, you sure? Phoebe just threw away two jacks because they didn't look happy..."
3352,"But... I'm ready, so, just deal."
3353,"OK, alright, last minute lesson, last minute lesson.  Joey... three... eight. Eight... three.  Alright babe, deal the cards."
3354,"Dammit, dammit, dammit!"
3355,": Oh I see, so then, you were lying."
3357,About how good your cards were.
3358,Heh... I was bluffing.
3359,A-ha! And... what is bluffing? Is it not another word for... lying?
3360,"OK, sorry to break up this party, but I've got resumes to fax before work tomorrow... "
3361,"Whoa, whoa, whoa!"
3362,"Rach, Rach, we gotta settle."
3363,Settle what?
3364,"The... Jamestown colony of Virginia. You see, King George is giving us the land, so..."
3365,"The game, Rachel, the game. You owe us money for the game."
3366,Oh. Right.
3367,"You know what, you guys? It's their first time, why don't we just forget about the money, alright?"
3368,"Hell no, we'll pay!"
3369,"OK, Monica? I had another answer all ready."
3370,And you know what? We want a rematch.
3371,Well that's fine with me. Could use the money.
3372,": So basically, you get your ya-yas by taking money from all of your friends."
3373,...Yeah.
3374,"Yes, and I get my ya-yas from Ikea. You have to put them together yourself, but they cost a little less."
3375,"Look, Rachel, this is poker. I play to win, alright? In order for me to win, other people have to lose. So if you're gonna play poker with me, don't expect me to be a 'nice guy,' OK? Cause once those cards are dealt... "
3376,...Yeah?
3377,I'm not a nice guy.
3378,"Alright boys, let's eat."
3379,"Oh, did you get that from the 'I Love Rachel' pizzeria?"
3380,You still on that?
3381,"Oh, come on. What was with that whole Black Bart speech? : When I play poker, I'm not a nice guy!"
3382,"You are way off, pal."
3383,"No, I don't think so, see Ross, because I think you love her."
3384,"Um.... no. See, I might've had feelings for her at one time--not any more. I just--I--"
3385,Marcel! Where are you going with that disc?
3386,"You are not putting that on again! Marcel, OK--if you press that button, you are in very, very big trouble."
3387,Can you believe what a jerk Ross was being?
3388,"Yeah, I know. He can get really competitive."
3389,"Ha. Ha, ha."
3391,"Oh, hello, kettle? This is Monica. You're black."
3392,Please! I am not as bad as Ross.
3393,"Oh, I beg to differ. The Pictionary incident?"
3394,"That was not an incident! I-I was gesturing, a-and the plate slipped out of my hand."
3395,Oooooh.  : Oh! I got an interview! I got an interview!
3396,You're kidding! Where? Where?
3397,: Sak's... Fifth... Avenue.
3398,"Oh, Rachel!"
3399,"Oh, it's like the mother ship is calling you home."
3400,"Well, what's the job?"
3401,Assistant buyer. Oh! I would be shopping... for a living!
3402,"OK, look. That is Aunt Iris. This woman has been playing poker since she was five. You gotta listen to every word she says.  Hi!"
3403,Is Tony Randall dead?
3407,"Well, he may be now, because I think I hit him with my car."
3411,No! That's bluffing. Lesson number one.  Let me tell you something... everything you hear at a poker game is pure crap. : Nice earrings.
3412,Thank y-- 
3413,"Girls, sit down."
3414,"Uh, Aunt Iris? This is Phoebe, and that's Rachel..."
3415,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, listen, I am parked at a meter. Let's do it."
3416,"Ross, could we please, please, please listen to anything else?"
3417,Alright.
3418,I'm gonna pay for that tonight.
3421,"Guys! Guess what, guess what, guess what, guess what!"
3422,"Um, ok... the... the fifth dentist caved and now they're all recommending Trident?"
3423,"Noooo... the interview! She loved me! She absolutely loved me. We talked for like two and a half hours, we have the same taste in clothes, and--oh, I went to camp with her cousin... and, oh, the job is perfect. I can do this. I can do this well!"
3424,That's great! That's wonderful!
3425,"Oh God, oh, and then she told the funniest story--"
3426,"OK, great. You'll tell us and we'll laugh. Let's play poker."
3427,"Alright now listen, you guys, we talked about it, and if you don't want to play, we completely understand."
3428,"Oh yes, yes, we could play some other game... like, uh, I don't know... Pictionary?"
3429,"Ha, ha, very funny, very funny. But I think we'd like to give poker another try. Shall we, ladies?"
3430,"Yes, we should. I think we should."
3431,"Uh, Rach, do you want me to shuffle those?"
3432,"No, no, thats OK. Y'know, I think I'm gonna give it a go."
3435,"So, Phoebs owes $7.50, Monica, you owe $10, and Rachel, you owe fifteen big ones."
3436,"But hey, thanks for teachin' us Cross-Eyed Mary. You guys, we gotta play that at our regular game."
3437,"Alright, here's my $7.50.  But I think you should know that this money is cursed."
3439,"Oh, I cursed it. So now bad things will happen to he who spends it."
3440,"That's alright, I'll take it. Bad things happen to me anyway. This way I can break 'em up with a movie."
3441,"Well, that just leaves the big Green poker machine, who owes fifteen..."
3442,"Mmm-hmmm. Oh, so typical. Ooo, I'm a man. Ooo, I have a penis. Ooo, I have to win money to exert my power over women. "
3443,"You know what? This is not over. We will play you again, and we will win, and you will lose, and you will beg, and we will laugh, and we will take every last dime you have, and you will hate yourselves forever."
3444,"Hmm. Kinda stepped on my point there, Mon."
3445,"So, you gals wanna hand over your money now? That way, we don't have to go through the formality of actually playing."
3446,"Ooooh, that's fine. We'll see who has the last laugh there, monkey boy."
3447,"OK, we done with the chit-chat? Are we ready to play some serious poker?"
3448,"Hey you guys, look, the one-eyed jack follows me wherever I go.  Right, OK, serious poker."
3449,"Excuse me, where are you going?"
3450,Uh... to the bathroom.
3451,"Do you want to go to the bathroom, or do you wanna play poker?"
3452,I want to go to the bathroom. 
3453,"Alright, well, I'm gonna order a pizza. "
3454,"Oh no no no no no, I'm still waiting to hear from that job and the store closes at nine, so you can eat then."
3455,That's fine. I'll just have a Tic-Tac to hold me over.
3456,"Alright, Cincinnati, no blinds, everybody ante. "
3457,Yes!  .... or no.
3458,"Alright. : Your money's mine, Green."
3459,"Your fly is open, Geller. "
3460,"You guys, you know what I just realized? 'Joker' is 'poker' with a 'J.' Coincidence?"
3461,"Hey, that's... that's 'joincidence' with a 'C'!"
3462,Uh... Phoebe? Phoebe?
3463,Yeah. Um... I'm out. 
3464,I'm in.
3465,Me too.
3466,"Me too. Alright, whattaya got."
3467,"Well, you better hop outta the shower, cause... I gotta flush. "
3468,"Well, well, well, hop back in bucko, cause I got four sixes!  I won! I actually won! Oh my God! Y'know what?  I think I'm gonna make a little Ross pile.  I think that one was Ross's, and I think--oh--that one was Ross's. Yes! : Well, I have got your money, and you'll never see it..."
3469,And your fly's still open...
3470,"Ha, I made you look...."
3471,I couldn't be inner. Monica?
3472,"Monica, in or out?"
3473,I hate this game!
3474,"OK Joey, your bet."
3475,"Ahhh, I fold like a cheap hooker who got hit in the stomach by a fat guy with sores on his face.  Oh, I'm out."
3476,Ross?
3477,"Oh, I am very in."
3479,Couldn't be more out. 
3480,Me too. Rachel.
3481,"Uh, I will see you... and I'll raise you.  What do you say... want to waste another buck?"
3482,"No, not this time.  So... what'd you have?"
3483,I'm not telling. 
3484,"Come on, show them to me. "
3485,No..!
3486,Show them to me!
3487,Get your hands out of there! No!
3488,Let me see! Show them!
3489,"Y'know, I've had dates like this."
3490,"Boy, you really can't stand to lose, can you? Your whole face is getting red... little veins popping out on your temple..."
3491,Plus that shirt doesn't really match those pants.
3492,"First of all, I'm not losing..."
3493,"Oh, you are losing. Definitely losing. "
3494,Let's not talk about losing. Just deal the--
3495,"Hel-lo, Rachel Green."
3496,"Mee mee, mee-mee mee."
3497,: Excuse me. : It's about the job.
3498,"Barbara! Hi, how are you?  Uh-huh.  No, I understand. Yeah. Oh, oh, come on, no, I'm fine. Don't be silly. Yeah... oh, but you know, if-if anything else opens up, plea--Hello? Hello? "
3499,"Sorry, Rach."
3500,"Y'know, there's gonna be lots of other stuff."
3501,"Yeah.......OK. Where were we? Oh, OK... five card draw, uh... jacks or better... nothing wild, everybody ante."
3502,"Look, Rachel, we don't have to do this."
3503,"Yes, we do. "
3504,"Alright, check."
3505,Check.
3506,I'm in for fifty cents. 
3507,Call.
3509,I see your fifty cents... and I raise you... five dollars. 
3510,"I thought, uh... it was a fifty cent limit."
3511,"Well, I just lost a job, and I'd like to raise the bet five bucks. Does anybody have a problem with that?"
3512,: Loser?
3513,"No, I fold. "
3514,"What do you mean, you fold? Hey, come on! What is this? I thought that 'once the cards were dealt, I'm not a nice guy.' I mean, what, were you just full of it?"
3515,I'm in. 
3516,How many you want?
3517,One. 
3518,Dealer takes two.  What do you bet?
3519,I bet two dollars. 
3520,OK... see your two... and I raise you twenty. 
3521,"I see your twenty, raise you twenty-five. "
3522,"See your twenty-five...and...uh, Monica, get my purse."
3523,"Rachel, there's nothing in it."
3524,"OK, then get me your purse."
3525,"OK, here you go. Good luck."
3526,": Thank you. : I saw your twenty-five, and I raise you... seven."
3527,...teen! 
3528,": Joey, I'm a little shy."
3529,"That's OK, Ross, you can ask me. What?"
3530,": What do you need, what do you need?"
3531,Fifteen.
3532,"Alright, here's ten. "
3533,"Here, I got five, I got five. "
3535,Good luck.
3536,": OK, I am calling your seventeen. What do you got?"
3537,Full house.
3539,": Ahhh, that's alright. Y'know, that's a tough hand to b*at."
3540,: I thought we had them!
3541,"Oh, well, when you don't have the cards, you don't have the cards, you know.  But, uh... look how happy she is. "
3542,Airplane! Airport! Airport '75! Airport '77! Airport '79!
3543,"Oh, time's up."
3544,Bye... bye... BIRDIE.
3546,That's a bird?
3547,That's a bird!
3548,"OK, OK, it's my turn. "
3549,Go.
3550,Uh.... bean! Bean!
3551,The Unbearable Likeness of Being!
3553,"That, you get? That, you get?"
3554,"Okay, okay, I checked. We have: Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Cinnamon Stick, Camomile, Mint Medley, Blackberry, and.. oh, wait, there's one more, um.. Lemon Soother. You're not the guy that asked for the tea, are you?  Okay."
3555,"Mail call, Rachel Green, bunk seven."
3556,"Thank you.  Oh, cool! Free sample of coffee!"
3557,Oh good! 'Cause where else would we get any?
3558,Oh. Right. ...Oh great.
3560,"Country club newsletter. My mother sends me the engagement notices for 'inspiration'. Oh my God! Oh my God, it's Barry and Mindy!"
3561,Barry who you almost-?
3562,Barry who I almost.
3563,"And Mindy, your maid of-?"
3564,"Mindy, my maid of. Oh!"
3565,"That's Mindy? Wow, she is pretty.  Lucky. To have had a friend like you."
3566,"Marcel. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Bring me the rice, c'mon. Good boy. Good boy. C'mere, gimme the rice.  Thank you, good boy. Well, I see he's finally mastered the difference between 'bring me the' and 'pee in the'.  'Bring me the' and- Rach?"
3569,"Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, this is so stupid! I mean, I gave Barry up, right? I should be happy for them! I am, I'm happy for them."
3571,"No. Oh, oh, I guess it would be different if I were- with somebody."
3572,"Whoah, uh, what happened to, uh, 'Forget relationships! I'm done with men!' The whole, uh, penis embargo?"
3573,"Oh, I don't know. I guess it's not about no guys, it's about the right guy, y'know? I mean, with Barry, it was safe and it was easy, but there was no heat. With Paolo, that's all there was, was heat! And it was just this raw- animal- sexual-"
3574,"Waitwait. I, I got it. I was there."
3575,"Well, I mean, do you think you can ever have both? Y'know? Someone who's like, who's like your best friend, but then also can make your toes curl?"
3576,"Yes. Yes. Yes! Yes, I really do! In fact, it's funny, very often, someone who you wouldn't think could- could curl your toes, might just be the one who..."
3578,...Gets interrupted. Hi!
3579,"Hi, how was the movie?"
3580,Wonderful!
3581,So good!
3582,Suck-fest.
3583,Toootal chick-flick.
3584,"I-I'm sorry it wasn't one of those movies with, like, y'know, g*n and b*mb and, like, buses going really fast..."
3585,"Hey, I don't need v*olence to enjoy a movie. Just so long as there's a little nudity."
3586,There was nudity!
3587,I meant female nudity. Alright? I don't need to see Lou Grant frolicking.
3588,Hugh! Hugh Grant!
3589,"Alright, I've gotta go. C'mon, Marcel! C'mon! We're gonna go take a bath. Yes we are, aren't we? Yes, we are."
3590,"They're still just friends, right?"
3591,And I will see you tomorrow!
3592,"That's right, you're gonna spend tomorrow at Aunt Rachel's, aren't you."
3593,"Oh, hang on, hang on. Does Aunt Monica get a say in this?"
3594,"'Pwease, Aunt Monica, pwease?' Oh, unclench. You're not even gonna be there."
3595,I can't believe we are even having this discussion.
3596,"I agree. I'm, like, in disbelief."
3597,"I mean, don't you think if things were gonna happen with Rachel, they would've happened already?"
3598,"I'm telling you, she said she's looking for a relationship with someone exactly like me."
3599,She really said that?
3600,"Well, I added the 'exactly like me' part... But she said she's looking for someone, and someone is gonna be there tonight."
3601,'Tonight' tonight?
3602,"Well, I think it's perfect. Y'know, it's just gonna be the two of us, she spent all day taking care of my monkey..."
3603,I can't remember the last time I got a girl to take care of my monkey.
3604,"Anyway, I figured after work I'd go pick up a bottle of wine, go over there and, uh, try to woo her."
3605,"Hey, y'know what you should do? You should take her back to the 1890's, when that phrase was last used."
3606,"Now, now the one in the feather boa, that's Dr. Francis. Now, she used to be a man. Okay, now look, see, there's Raven. We hate her. We're glad she's dying. Okay-  Wh- wh- Marcel, are you playing with Monica's shoes? You know you're not supposed to pl- whoah. Marcel, did you poo in the shoe?  Marcel, bad monkey! Oh! Oh!  Sorry, Barry. Little engagement gift. I'm sure you didn't register for that.  Who d*ed? Who d*ed? Roll him over! Oh, c'mon, roll him over! Oh...! Well, we know it wasn't Dexter, right Marcel? Because-  Marcel? Marc- "
3607,How could you lose him?
3608,"I don't know. We were watching TV, and then he pooped in Monica's shoe-"
3609,Wait. He pooped in my shoe? Which one?
3610,I don't know. The left one.
3611,Which ones?
3612,"Oh. Oh, those little clunky Amish things you think go with everything."
3615,"Whoah, ooh, why is the air in here so negative?"
3616,Rachel lost Marcel.
3617,"Oh no, how?"
3618,He- he pooped in my shoe.
3620,Those cute little black ones I wear all the time.
3621,"No, which one? The right or left? 'Cause the left one is lucky..."
3622,"C'mon, you guys, what're we gonna do, what're we gonna do?"
3623,Alright alright. You're a monkey. You're loose in the city. Where do you go?
3624,"Okay, it's his first time out, so he's probably gonna wanna do some of the touristy things. I'll go to Cats, you go to the Russian Tea Room."
3625,"Oh, my, God, c'mon, you guys! He's gonna be home any minute! He's gonna k*ll me!"
3626,"Okay, we'll start with the building. You guys take the first and second floor, Phoebe and I'll take third and fourth."
3627,"Well, what'm I gonna do? What'm I gonna do?"
3628,"Okay, you stay here, and just wait by the phone. Spray Lysol in my shoe, and wait for Ross to k*ll you."
3629,Anybody wanna trade? Oh...
3630,Whaddyou want?
3631,"Mr. Heckles, our friend lost a monkey. Have you seen it?"
3632,"I left a Belgian waffle out here, did you take it?"
3633,No!
3634,Why would you leave your Belgian waffle in the hall?
3635,I wasn't ready for it.
3636,A monkey. Have you seen a monkey?
3637,Saw Regis Philbin once...
3638,"Okay, thank you, Mr. Heckles. "
3639,You owe me a waffle.
3640,"Okay, he's a, he's a black capuchian monkey with a white face...  ...with, with Russian dressing and, and pickles on the side. Okay. Thanks."
3641,"Hey. How did, uh, how'd it go today?"
3642,"Great! It went great. Really great. Hey, is that wine?"
3643,"Yeah. You, uh, you want some?"
3644,"Oh, I would love some. But y'know what? Y'know what? Let's not drink it here. I'm feeling kinda crazy. You wanna go to Newark?"
3645,"Uh, okay, yeah, we could do that, but before we head off to the m*rder capital of the North-East, I was, uh, kinda wanting to run something by you. Y'know how we were, uh, y'know, talking before about, uh, relationships and stuff?  Well-"
3646,"Oh God, Ross, I cannot do this."
3647,"Okay, quick and painful.  "
3648,"Oh God... Okay. Alright. Alright. Okay. Ross, please don't hate me."
3649,"Oh, what? Whatwhat?"
3650,Y'know Marcel?
3652,"Well, I kind of... I kind of lost him."
3653,"I- I- I ca- I can't believe this. I mean, all I asked you to do was keep him in the apartment."
3654,"I know, I know, I'm sorry-"
3655,"No, y'know what, I guess it's partially my fault. Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil."
3656,"Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I-  Oh! Who is it?"
3657,Animal Control.
3658,See? I've even called Animal Control!
3659,You called Animal Control?
3660,Uh-huh... why... do you not like them?
3661,"Marcel is an illegal exotic animal. I'm not allowed to have him in the city. If they find him, they'll take him away from me."
3662,"O-okay, now see, you never ever ever told us that..."
3663,"That's right, I.. 'cause I didn't expect you were gonna invite them to the apartment!"
3664,"Hi, thanks for coming."
3665,Somebody called about a monkey?
3666,"Oh, y'know what? That was a complete misunderstanding! "
3667,"Yeah, we thought we had a monkey, but we-we didn't."
3668,Turned out it was a hat.
3669,Cat!
3670,Cat! What'm I saying? Cat!
3671,"Hi. We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel."
3672,Marcel?
3673,My uncle Marcel.
3674,"Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?"
3675,"Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?"
3676,Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?
3677,"Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?"
3678,"Yes, but there isn't always time!"
3679,"Look. I'm sure there's some friendly way to reconcile this! Um, have a seat. First of all, we haven't been introduced, I'm Monica Geller."
3680,"Oh my God, you are! And you're Rachel Green!"
3682,Luisa Gianetti! Lincoln High? I sat behind you guys in home room!
3683,Luisa? Oh my God! Monica! It's Luisa!
3684,The Luisa from home room!
3685,Yes!!
3686,"You have no idea who I am, do you."
3687,"No, none at all."
3688,None.
3689,"Well, maybe that's because you spent four years ignoring me. I mean, would it have been so hard to say 'Morning, Luisa'? Or 'Nice overalls'?"
3690,"Oh, I'm- I'm so sorry!"
3691,"Ah, it's not so much you, you were fat, you had your own problems.  But you? What a bitch!"
3693,"Be that as it may, d'you think you could just help us out here on that monkey thing? Y'know, just for old times' sake? Go Bobcats?"
3694,"I could... but I won't. If I find that monkey, he's mine. "
3695,Dun-dun-duuuur! Sorry.
3700,"Hi, can I help you?"
3701,"Um, we're kind of having an emergency and we- we were looking for something..."
3702,A monkey.
3703,Yes have you seen any?
3704,"No. No, haven't seen a monkey. Do you know anything about fixing radiators?"
3705,"Um, sure! Did you, uh, did you try turning the knob back the other way?"
3706,Of course.
3707,"Oh. Then, no."
3708,Did I put too much rum in here?
3709,Just a sec.  Hope you find your monkey. 
3710,"Oh, nononowaitwaitwaitnono! Uh... we may not know anything about radiators per se, but we do have a certain amount of expertise in the heating and cooling... mileu."
3711,"Uh, aren't we kind of in the middle of something here?"
3712,"Yes, but these women are very hot, and they need our help! And they're very hot."
3713,"We can't, alright?  We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out."
3714,"Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people."
3716,Marcel?!
3721,OhmyGod!
3722,Whaaat!
3723,Something just brushed up against my right leg!
3725,"Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg."
3726,"Look, Phoebe!"
3727,"Yeah! Oh, c'mere, Marcel! Oh, Marcel, c'mere!"
3728,"Step aside, ladies! "
3729,What're you gonna do?
3730,Just a small tranquiliser.
3731,"Run, Marcel, run! Run, Marcel!  Are you okay?"
3732,"Yeah, think so. Oh!  Huh.  Whoah."
3733,Oh gosh.
3736,"Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone."
3737,"Ross, you don't know that."
3738,"Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village.  And now I have a broken foot. I have no monkey, and a broken foot! Thank you very much."
3739,"Ross, I said I'm sorry like a million times. What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here.  Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!"
3740,"Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!"
3741,"Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose."
3742,"Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings..."
3744,"I don't even wanna hear it, you're just-"
3746,"Oh, forget it, okay?"
3749,"Hey! Hey, Bananaman!"
3750,"Oh, this is so intense. One side of my butt is totally asleep, and the other side has no idea."
3751,"Hi, did you order some bananas?"
3752,What about it?
3753,Gimme back my monkey.
3754,I don't have a monkey.
3755,Then what's with all the bananas?
3756,Potassium.
3757,"Marcel? Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?"
3758,Marcel! What've you done to him?
3759,"That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey."
3760,"Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon. "
3761,"C'mere, Patti. "
3762,"C'mere, Marcel. "
3764,"Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Here, monkey!  Gotcha."
3765,"Okay, gimme my monkey back."
3766,That's my monkey.
3767,You're both gonna have to take this up with the judge.
3768,"That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever."
3769,"Alright, I want my monkey."
3771,"Oh, c'mon, Luisa!"
3772,"Sorry, prom queen."
3773,"You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat."
3774,"Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!"
3776,"Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you sh*t my friend in the ass with a dart?"
3777,"It'll be nice to get this off finally, won't it? Yes it will.  Or we can leave it on for now, that's fine."
3778,"Y'know, with the right pair of pumps, that would be a great little outfit."
3779,"Listen, I'm- I'm sorry I was so hard on you before, it's just I-"
3780,"Oh, Ross, c'mon. It's my fault, I almost lost your-"
3781,"Yeah, but you were the one who got him back, y'know? You, you were great. ...Hey, we uh, we still have that, uh, that bottle of wine. You in the mood for, uh, something grape?"
3782,That'd be good.
3783,"Alright.  The, uh, the neighbours must be vacuuming.  Well, so long as we're here and, uh, not on the subject, I was thinking about, uh, how mad we got at each other before, and, um, I was thinking maybe it was partially because of how we, um-"
3785,Barry?!
3786,"I can't. I can't do it, I can't marry Mindy. I think I'm still in love with you."
3788,We have got to start locking that door!
3789,This is me in The Sound of Music. See the von Trapp kids?
3791,That's because I'm in front of them.
3792,Eh. I thought that was an alp.
3793,"Well, high school was not my favourite time."
3794,"I dunno, I loved high school. Y'know? It was just four years of parties and dating and sex."
3795,"Yeah, well I went to boarding school with four hundred boys. Any sex I had would've involved a major lifestyle choice."
3796,"Gosh, doesn't it seem like a million years ago?"
3797,Oh. Oooh! Ooh! Ooh!  Ooh! My butt cheek is waking up! Oooh! Ooh!
3798,I can't believe you would actually say that. I would much rather be Mr.Peanut than Mr.Salty.
3799,"No way! Mr.Salty is a sailor, all right, he's got to be, like, thetoughest snack there is."
3800,"I don't know, you don't wanna mess with corn nuts. They're craaazy."
3801,Oh my God. You guys! You gotta come see this! There's some creep out there with a telescope!
3802,I can't believe it! He's looking right at us!
3803,"Oh, that is so sick."
3804,I feel violated. And not in a good way.
3805,"How can people do that?...  Oh, you guys, look! Ugly Naked Guy got gravity boots!"
3806,"I am telling you, years from now, schoolchildren will study it as one of the greatest first dates of all time. It was unbelievable! We could totally be ourselves, we didn't have to play any games..."
3807,So have you called her yet?
3808,"Let her know I like her? What are you, insane?  It's the next day! How needy do I want to seem?  I'm right, right?"
3809,"Oh, yeah. Yeah. Let her dangle."
3810,I can't believe my parents are actually pressuring me to find one of you people.
3811,"Oh, God, just do it!  Call her! Stop being so testosteroney!"
3812,"Which, by the way, is the real San Francisco treat.  I got her machine."
3813,Her answer machine?
3814,"No, interestingly enough her leaf blower picked up."
3815,"So, uh, why didn't you say anything?"
3816,"Oh, no no no no. Last time I left a spontaneous message I ended up using the phrase 'Yes indeedy-o'."
3817,"Look look! It's Rachel and Barry. No, don't everybody look at once!"
3818,"Okay, okay, what's going on?"
3819,"Okay, they're just talking..."
3820,"Yeah, well, does he look upset? Does he look like he was just told to shove anything?"
3821,"No, no actually, he's smiling.. and... Oh my God, don't do that!!"
3822,What? What? What?!
3823,That man across the street just kicked that pigeon!  Oh!
3824,"And basically, that's how a bill becomes a law."
3825,Oh!... Right!
3826,Hey Rach!
3827,How'd it go?
3828,"Y'know, it was, uh.. it was actually really great. He took me to lunch at the Russian Tea Room, and I had that chicken, where y'know you poke it and all the butter squirts out..."
3829,Not a good day for birds...
3830,"Then we took a walk down to Bendall's, and I told him not to, but he got me a little bottle of Chanel..."
3831,"That's nice... now, was that before or after you told him to stop calling, stop sending you flowers and to generally leave you alone, hmm?"
3832,"Right,.. well,.. we never actually got to that... Oh, it was just so nice to see him again, y'know? It was comfortable, it was familiar... it was just nice!"
3833,"That's, that's nice twice!"
3834,"Rachel, what's going on? I mean isn't this the same Barry who you left at the altar?"
3835,"Duh, where've you been?"
3836,"Yeah, but it was different with him today! And he wasn't, like, Orthodontist Guy, y'know? I mean, we had fun! Is there anything wrong with that?"
3839,I have my reasons.
3840,"Okay, how about the fact that he's engaged to another woman, who just happens to be your ex- best friend?"
3841,"All right. All right all right all right all right, I know it's stupid! I will go see him this afternoon, and I will just put an end to it!"
3842,Wow... Wow!
3844,"I'm not crazy, right? I mean, it was never like that."
3845,"Nooo, it wasn't."
3846,"Ooh, and it's so nice having this little sink here..."
3847,"Oh, Danielle! I wasn't expecting the machine... Give me a call when you get a chance.  Bye bye.  Oh God!"
3848,THAT's what you've been working on for the past two hours?!
3849,"Hey, I've been honing!"
3850,What was with the dishes?
3851,"Oh, uh.. I want her to think I might be in a restaurant.. y'know? I might have some kind of life, like I haven't been sitting around here honing for the past few hours."
3852,"Look look! He's doing it again, the guy with the telescope!"
3853,Oh my God!  Go away!  Stop looking in here!
3854,"Great, now he's waving back."
3855,"Man, we gotta do something about that guy. This morning, I caught him looking into our apartment. It creeps me out! I feel like I can't do stuff!"
3856,What kinda stuff..?
3857,"Will you grow up? I'm not talking about sexy stuff, but, like, when I'm cooking naked."
3858,You cook naked?
3859,"Yeah, toast, oatmeal... nothing that spatters."
3860,What are you looking at me for? I didn't know that.
3862,"Oh, it's just... Oh, Barry, this was not good."
3863,"No, it was. It was very very good."
3864,"Well, what about Mindy?"
3865,"Oh, way, way better than Mindy."
3866,"No, not that, I mean, what about you and Mindy?"
3867,"Well, if you want, I'll just- I'll just break it off with her."
3868,"No. No no no no, no. I mean, don't do that. Not, I mean not for me. "
3869,"Dr. Farber, Bobby Rush is here for his adjustment."
3870,"Thanks, Bernice.  Let's go away this weekend."
3871,"Oh, Barry..! Come on, this is all way too.."
3872,"We can, we can go to Aruba! When I went there on what would have been our honeymoon, it was, uh... it was really nice. You would've liked it."
3873,I had a bra.
3874,"Hey, Dr. Farber."
3875,"All right Miss Green, everything looks fine... Yep, I think we're starting to see some real progress here."
3877,"I'm twelve, I'm not stupid."
3878,Can I use your phone?
3879,"Yeah.. uh, but for future reference, that thing in your hand can also be used as a phone."
3880,"Yes, it's working! Why isn't she calling me back?"
3881,Maybe she never got your message.
3882,"Y'know, if you want, you can call her machine, and if she has a lot of beeps, that means she probably didn't get her messages yet."
3883,Y'don't think that makes me seem a little...
3884,"...desperate, needy, pathetic?"
3885,"Ah, you obviously saw my personal ad."
3886,How many beeps?
3887,She answered.
3888,"Y'see, this is where you'd use that 'hello' word we talked about."
3889,"I'm not gonna talk to her, she obviously got my message and is choosing not to call me. Now I'm needy and snubbed. God, I miss just being needy."
3890,Hey! Hi!
3891,How'd he take it?
3892,"Pretty well, actually... "
3893,"Uh, Rach... how come you have dental floss in your hair?"
3894,"Oh, do I?"
3895,Uh huh.
3896,....We ended up having sex in his chair.
3897,"You had SEX in his CHAIR?!... I said that a little too loudly, didn't I?"
3898,You- you had what?
3899,Sex in his chair.
3900,"What, uh... what were you thinking?"
3901,"I don't know! I mean, we still care about each other. There's a history there. 'S'like you and Carol."
3902,"No! No no, it is nothing like me and Carol!"
3903,"Please. If she said to you, ""Ross, I want you on this couch, right here, right now"", what would you say? "
3904,"If it helps, I could slide over."
3905,"It's, it's, it's, uh, a totally diferent situation! It's, it's apples and oranges, it's, it's orthodontists and lesbi- I gotta go."
3906,Where are you going?
3907,"I just have to go, all right? Do I need a reason? Huh? I mean I have things to do with my life, I have a jam packed schedule, and I am late- for keeping up with it. Okay?"
3908,Hello? Hello?
3909,"Hello? Mindy! Hi! Hey, how are you? Yes, yes, I've heard, congratulations, that is so great. Really? Oh. Okay. Okay, well I'm working tomorrow, but if you want you can, you can, you can come by and... okay... great... great... all right, so I'll, so I'll see you tomorrow! Okay.. okay... bye.  Oh God. Oh God. Oh God."
3910,So how's Mindy?
3911,"Oh, she wants to see me tomorrow...Oh, she sounded really weird, I gotta call Barry...  Hi, it's me, I just.. Mindy!! Mindy! Hi! No, I figured that's where you'd be!"
3912,Brrrrrrr!
3913,Hell is filled with people like you.
3914,He's back! The peeper's back!
3915,Get down!
3916,Get down?
3917,...And boogie!
3918,"Thanks, but I gotta go to work and get my eyes scratched out by Mindy."
3919,"Relax. Y'know, she may not even know."
3920,"Please. I haven't heard from her in seven months, and now she calls me? I mean, what else is it about? Oh! She was my best friend, you guys! We went to camp together... she taught me how to kiss.."
3922,"And now, y'know, I'm like... I'm like the other woman! I feel so.."
3923,..Naughty!
3924,"Right, I'll see you guys later..."
3925,"Oh, hold up, I'll walk out with you. Now, Rach, when she taught you to kiss, you were at camp, and.. were you wearing any kinda little uniform, or-  That's fine, yeah..."
3926,"Okay, I'm gonna go to the bathroom. Will you watch my phone?"
3927,Why don't you just take it with you?
3928,"Hey, we haven't been on a second date, she needs to hear me pee?"
3929,Why don't you just call her?
3930,"I can't call her, I left a message! I have some pride."
3931,Do you?
3932,"No!  Danielle, hi! It's, uh, it's Chandler! I'm fine. Uh, listen, I don't know if you tried to call me, because, uh, idiot that I am, I accidentally shut off my phone. Oh, uh, okay, that's fine, that's great. Okay.  She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back.  She's on the other line, she's gonna call me back, she's on the other line, gonna call me back..."
3933,Don't you have to pee?
3934,'S'why I'm dancing...
3935,Mindy.
3936,"Hey, you."
3937,"Hey, you.... So, what's up?"
3938,Um.. we should really be sitting for this.
3939,Sure we should... So.
3940,"Now- I know things've been weird lately, but you're like my oldest friend in the world.. except for maybe Laurie Schaffer, who I don't talk to anywhere, 'cause she's all bitter now that she lost the weight and it turns out she doesn't have a pretty face. ....Okay, I'm just gonna ask you this once, and I want a straight answer."
3942,Will you be my maid of honour?
3943,Of course!
3944,Oh that's so great!
3945,Was that all you wanted to ask me?
3946,That's all!
3947,Ohhhh!!  ...What? What?
3948,That's not all.
3949,Oh sure it is!
3950,"Oh no, it isn't! No! I think Barry is seeing someone in the city."
3951,"Um, what- what would make you think that?"
3952,"Well, ever since we announced the engagement, he's been acting really weird, and then last night, he came home smelling like Chanel."
3953,"Really. Mindy, if it'll make you feel any better, when I was engaged to him he went through a whole weird thing too."
3954,"Oh God! You see, that's what I was afraid of!"
3955,What? What's what you were afraid of?
3956,"Okay, okay... when Barry was engaged to you, he and I- kind of- had a little thing on the side."
3958,"I know. I know, and when he proposed to me, everyone said ""Don't do it, he's just gonna do to you what he did to Rachel"", and- now I feel so stupid."
3959,"Uh.. Oh, Mindy, you are so stupid. Oh, we are both so stupid."
3960,What do you mean?
3961,Smell familiar?
3962,Oh no.
3963,"Oh, I am so sorry."
3964,"No me, I am so sorry..."
3965,Oh my.
3966,"Four letters: ""Circle or hoop""."
3967,"Ring dammit, ring!"
3969,"Hey, you know our phone's not working?"
3971,"I tried to call you from the coffee shop, and there was no answer."
3972,"I turned it off. Mother of God, I turned it off!"
3973,Just like you told her you did!  ... Just pointing out the irony.
3974,"Hey, so listen, I went across the street and talked to the doorman- I got the peeper's name! Can I use the phone?"
3975,Nngghhh!!!!!!!
3976,"Can I use your phone?  Yeah, the number for a Sidney Marks, please."
3977,"""Heating device""."
3978,Radiator.
3979,Five letters.
3980,Rdtor.
3981,"Yeah, is Sidney there? Oh, this is?  Sidney's a woman."
3982,So she's a woman! So what?
3983,"Yeah. Yeah, so what?  Look, I live across the street,  and I know all about you and your little telescope, and I don't appreciate it, okay? Yeah, I can see you right now! Hello! If I wanna walk around my apartment in my underwear, I shouldn't have to feel like- Thank you, but... that's not really the point... The point is that... mostly free weights, but occasionally.."
3984,Joey!!
3985,"Yeah, my neighbour... Yeah, the brunette...  She says you looked very pretty the other day in the green dress."
3986,The green dress? Really?
3987,"Yeah, she said you looked like Ingrid Bergman that day."
3988,Nooo!
3989,Hey. Got a second?
3990,"Sure, sure. Come on...  ...in..."
3991,"Hello, sweetheart."
3992,Uh... uh... what're'you... what're'you guys doing here?
3993,"Uh, we are here to break up with you."
3994,Both of you?
3995,"Basically, we think you're a horrible human being, and bad things should happen to you."
3996,"I'm sorry... I'm sorry, God, I am so sorry, I'm an idiot, I was weak, I couldn't help myself! Whatever I did, I only did because I love you so much!"
3997,"Uh- which one of us are you talking to there, Barr?"
3998,"....Mindy. Mindy, of course Mindy, it was always Mindy."
3999,Even when we were having sex in that chair?
4000,"I swear, whatever I was doing, I was always thinking of you."
4001,Please! During that second time you couldn't have picked her out of a lineup!
4002,You did it twice?
4003,"Well, the first time didn't really count... I mean, y'know, 's'Barry."
4004,Okay...
4005,"Sweetheart, just gimme- gimme another chance, okay, we'll start all over again. We'll go back to Aruba."
4006,"Dr. Farber, we've got a bit of an emergency here...Jason Costalano is choking on his retainer."
4007,"Oh God...  I'll be right there, Bernice.  Look, please, please don't go anywhere, okay? I'll be- I'll be right back."
4008,"Okay. Okay, we'll be here! Hating you! Did you see how he was sweating when he walked out of there? Listen honey, if I'm hogging the ball too much you just jump right in there and take a couple punches because I'm telling you, this feels GREAT."
4009,Yeah... I'm pretty sure I'm still gonna marry him.
4010,"What are you talking about?! Mindy, the guy is the devil! He's Satan in a smock!"
4011,"Look, I know he's not perfect, but the truth is, at the end of the day, I still really wanna be Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, DDS."
4012,Oh God. 
4013,I hope you can find some way to be happy for me. And I hope you'll still be my maid of honour...?
4014,And I hope Barry doesn't k*ll you and eat you in Aruba.
4015,You okay?
4018,"Yeah! Y'know, ever since I ran out on Barry at the wedding, I have wondered whether I made the right choice. And now I know."
4019,Aww... 
4020,Big day.
4021,"All right, I'll give you this, Mr. Peanut is a better dresser. I mean he's got the monocle, he's got the top hat..."
4022,You know he's gay?
4023,I just wanna clarify this: are you outing Mr. Peanut?
4025,"Danielle! Hi! Uh- everybody, this is Danielle, Danielle, everybody."
4026,Hi. Hi.
4027,What are you doing here?
4028,"Well, I've been calling you, but it turns out I had your number wrong. And when I finally got the right one from Information, there was no answer. So I thought I'd just come down here, and make sure you were okay."
4029,"...I'm, I'm okay."
4030,"Listen uh, maybe we could get together later?"
4031,"That sounds good. I'll call you- or you call me, whatever..."
4034,"G'bye, everybody."
4035,Bye.
4036,Whoo-hoo!
4037,"Yeah, there you go!"
4038,Second date!
4039,...I dunno.
4040,You DON'T KNOW?
4041,"Well, she seems very nice and everything, but that whole thing about her coming all the way down here, just to see if I was okay? I mean,... how needy is that?"
4042,How could someone get a hold of your credit card number?
4043,I have no idea. But look how much they spent!
4044,"Monica, would you calm down? The credit card people said that you only have to pay for the stuff that you bought."
4045,I know. It's just such reckless spending.
4046,"I think when someone steals your credit card, they've kind of already thrown caution to the wind."
4047,"Wow, what a geek. They spent $69.95 on a Wonder Mop."
4048,That's me.
4049,"Oh! The yuk! Ross, he's doing it again! "
4050,"Marcel, stop humping the lamp! Stop humping! Now Marcel, come back-  come here, Marcel-"
4051,"Oh no, not in my room! I'll get him."
4052,"Ross, you've got to do something about the humping."
4053,"What? It's, it's just a phase."
4054,"Well, that's what we said about Joey..."
4055,Would you all relax? It's not that big a deal.
4056,Stop it! Marcel! Bad monkey!
4058,Let's just say my Curious George doll is no longer curious.
4059,"Oh, Monica. You are not still going over that thing."
4060,This woman's living my life.
4062,"She's living my life, and she's doing it better than me! Look at this, look. She buys tickets for plays that I wanna see. She, she buys clothes from stores that I'm intimidated by the sales people. She spent three hundred dollars on art supplies."
4063,You're not an artist.
4064,"Yeah, well I might be if I had the supplies! I mean, I could do all this stuff. Only I don't."
4065,"Oh, Monica, c'mon, you do cool things."
4066,"Oh really? Okay, let's compare, shall we."
4067,"Oh, it's so late for 'Shall we'..."
4068,Do I go horseback riding in the park? Do I take classes at the New School?
4069,Nooo...
4070,"This is so unfair! She's got everything I want, and she doesn't have my mother."
4071,How about Joey... Pepponi?
4072,"No, still too ethnic. My agent thinks I should have a name that's more neutral."
4073,Joey... Switzerland?
4074,"Plus, y'know, I think it should be Joe. Y'know, Joey makes me sound like I'm, I dunno, this big.  Which I'm not."
4075,Joe...Joe...Joe...Stalin?
4076,Stalin...Stalin...do I know that name? It sounds familiar.
4077,"Well, it does not ring a bell with me..."
4078,"Joe Stalin. Y'know, that's pretty good."
4079,Might wanna try Joseph.
4080,Joseph Stalin. I think you'd remember that!
4081,"Oh yes! Bye Bye Birdie, starring Joseph Stalin. Joseph Stalin is the Fiddler on the Roof."
4084,"Hi.  Hi, uh, yes, this is Monica Geller. Um, I believe I'm taking some classes with you and I was wondering what they were."
4086,"Alright, great. Thanks a lot.  I'm going to tap class."
4087,"What, what, so that you can dance with the woman that stole your credit card?"
4088,"This woman's got my life, I should get to see who she is."
4089,"Go to the post office! I'm sure her picture's up! ...Okay, Monica, y'know what, honey, you're kinda losing it here! I mean, this is really becoming like a weird obsession thing."
4090,"This is madness. It's madness, I tell you, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, MONICA, DON'T DO IT!! ...Thank you."
4091,What d'you think?
4092,Lotsa things.
4093,Which one do you think she is?
4094,May I help you?
4095,"Oh, no thanks, we're just here to observe."
4096,You don't observe a dance class. You dance a dance class. Spare shoes are over there.
4097,What does she mean?
4098,"I think she means  'You dance a dance class'. Oh, c'mon, c'mon. "
4099,"Okay, d'y'see anybody you think could be me?"
4100,People! Last time there were some empty yoghurt containers lying around after class. Let's not have that happen again!
4101,She could be you.
4102,"Let's get started. Five, six, a-five six seven eight..."
4103,"Okay, I'm not getting this!"
4104,I'm totally getting it!
4105,Did you ever feel like sometimes you are just so unbelievably uncoordinated?
4106,What? You just click when they click.
4107,"Alright people, now everyone grab a partner."
4108,"Okay. And, my, dead, mother, says, you, are, it. I'm with Rachel."
4109,Great. It's gym class all over again.
4110,Aww.
4111,"Well that's all right, you can come up to the front and dance with me."
4112,Why don't I just take off my clothes and have a nightmare.
4113,"It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. Sorry I'm late, okay, here I am. Who's the new tense girl?"
4114,She's your partner.
4115,Hi. I'm Monica.
4116,Oh. Monica! ...Hi. I'm Mo- ...nana.
4117,Monana?
4118,Yeah. It's Dutch.
4119,You're kidding! I-I spent three years in Amsterdam. 
4120,"Um, Pennsylvania Dutch."
4121,"And we're dancing. A-five, six, seven, eight..."
4124,Where've you been?
4125,At the vet.
4126,"She's not gonna make you wear one of those big plastic cones, is she?"
4127,She says Marcel's humping thing's not a phase. Apparently he's reached sexual maturity.
4128,Hey! He b*at ya.
4129,"She says as time goes on, he's gonna start getting agressive and violent."
4131,I'm gonna have to give him up.
4132,"I can't believe it, Ross. This sucks!"
4133,"I don't get it, I mean, you just got him. How can he be an adult already?"
4134,"I know. I know. I mean, one day, he's this little thing, and before you know it, he's this little thing I can't get off my leg."
4135,Isn't there any way you can keep him?
4136,"No, no. The vet says unless he's in a place where he has regular access to some... monkey lovin', he's just gonna get vicious. I've just gotta get him into a zoo."
4137,How do you get a monkey into a zoo?
4138,"I know that one! ...No, that's Popes into a Volkswagen."
4139,"Well, we're applying to a lot of them. Naturally our first choice would be one of the bigger state zoos, y'know, like, uh, San Diego... right? But that might just be a pipe dream, because, y'know, he's out of state. Uh, my vet, uh, knows someone at Miami, so that's a possibility."
4140,"Yeah, but that's like two blocks away from the beach. I mean, it's a total party zoo."
4141,"Hey. We found her, we found the girl."
4143,Did you call the cops?
4144,Nope. We took her to lunch.
4145,Ah. Your own brand of vigilante justice.
4146,What?! Are you insane? This woman stole from you. She stole. She's a stealer.
4147,"Y'know what? After you're with this woman for like ten minutes, you forget all that. I mean, she is this astounding person, with this- with this amazing spirit."
4148,"Yeah, which she probably stole from some cheerleader."
4149,...Take off their hats!
4150,Popes in a Volkswagen! ...I love that joke.
4151,No way. No way did you do this.
4152,Monana was very brave.
4153,It was so wild. We told them we were the g*n in room six fifteen. Only to find out the Boston Celtics had taken over the entire sixth floor!
4154,"So once they caught on to the fact that we're, y'know, short and have breasts..."
4155,...They threw us out! I was thrown out of a hotel! Me!
4156,"Go Monana! Well, you ladies are not the only ones living the dream. I get to go pour coffee for people I don't know. Don't wait up. "
4157,"Oh, by the way, tomorrow we're auditioning for a Broadway show."
4158,'Scuse me?
4159,"There's an open call for Cats. I'm thinking we go down there, sing Memories and make complete fools of ourselves. Whaddya say?"
4160,"Nononononono. Think who you're dealing with here. I mean, I'm not like you. I-I can't even stand in front of a tap class."
4161,"Well, that's just probably 'cause of your Amish background."
4163,"Well, you're Pennsylvania Dutch, right?"
4164,"Right. Till I bought a blow dryer, then I was shunned."
4165,I-I used to be just like you. And then one day I saw a movie that changed my life. Did you ever see Dead Poets' Society?
4167,"I thought that movie was so incredibly... boring. I mean, that thing at the end where the kid kills himself because he can't be in the play? What was that?! It's like, kid, wait a year, leave home, do some community theatre. I walked out of there and I thought, 'Now, that's two hours of my life that I'm never getting back'. And that thought scared me more than all the other crap I was afraid to do."
4168,Wow. Then I would definitely not recommend Mrs. Doubtfire.
4169,"Oh God.  We didn't get into Scranton.  That was like our safety zoo. They take like dogs and cows. See? I don't know who this is harder on, me or him."
4170,I'd say that chair's taking the brunt.
4171,"Marcel! Marcel! Marcel, no! Good boy. See, how can nobody want him?"
4172,"Oh, somebody will."
4173,You know there already is a Joseph Stalin?
4174,You're kidding.
4175,Apparently he was this Russian dictator who slaughtered all these people. You'd think you would've known that!
4176,"Y'know, you'd think I would've."
4177,Phoebe. Whaddyou think a good stage name for me would be?
4178,...Flame Boy.
4179,Where exactly is your zoo?
4180,"Well, it's technically not a zoo per se, it's more of an interactive wildlife experience. Let me ask you some questions about, is it, uh, Marcel?"
4182,"Does he, uh, fight with other animals?"
4183,"Nono, he's, he's very docile."
4184,Even if he were... cornered?
4185,"Well I, I don't know. Why?"
4186,"Uh, how is he at handling small objects?"
4187,"He can hold a banana, if that's whatcha mean..."
4188,"How about a hammer, or a small blade?"
4189,Why- why- why would he need a blade?
4190,"Well, if he's up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns, you've got to give the little guy something. Otherwise it's just cruel."
4191,"He- he- he got in, he- he got in to San Diego."
4192,"We, we come back from our walk and the- the phone was ringing-"
4193,-He's in.
4194,"He's in! Oh, did you hear that, Marcel? San Diego. San Diego!"
4195,"You're making a big mistake here. I mean, San Diego's all well and good, but if you give him to me, I'll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains."
4196,Yo- hooo!
4197,Where the hell've you been?
4198,Monica and I just crashed an embassy party.
4199,Are you drunk?!
4200,Noooo!  I'm lying. I am so drunk.
4201,"Oh God, oh. Great, Monica, y'know what, you could've called, I have been up here, I've been worried..."
4202,Monica? Monica!
4203,Water rules!
4204,"Yes, yes, it does. Okay, look, the restaurant called, they wanna know if you're gonna be showing up for work?"
4205,Nope. Going to the Big Apple Circus today.
4206,"Okay Monica, what are you doing? You're gonna lose your job! This is not you!"
4207,"No, it is me! Y'know, I'm not just the person who needs to fluff the pillows and pay the bills as soon as they come in! Y'know, when I'm with her, I am so much more than that. I'm- I'm Monana!"
4208,"Hello? Yes, she is, hold on a second, please. Monana, it's for you, the credit card people."
4209,Helloooo? Yeah. Oh my God. Thanks.
4211,They've arrested Monica.
4214,How are you?
4215,"I'm not too bad. Fortunately, blue's my colour. How- how did you know I was here?"
4216,Because... I'm Monica Geller. It was my credit card you were using.
4217,That I was not expecting.
4218,"I want you to know, it wasn't me who turned you in."
4219,Oh. Thanks.
4220,"No, thank you! You have given me so much! I mean, if it wasn't for you, I would never have gotten to sing Memories on the stage at the Wintergarden Theatre!"
4221,"Well, actually, you only got to sing 'Memo-'."
4222,"I just can't believe you're in here. I mean, what am I gonna do without you? Who's gonna crash the embassy parties with me? Who's gonna take me to the Big Apple Circus?"
4223,"Monica, I started my day by peeing in front of twenty-five other women, and you're worried about who's gonna take you to the Big Apple Circus?"
4224,"Well, not... worried, just... wondering."
4225,"There's nothing to wonder about, Monica. You're gonna go back to being exactly who you were, because that's who you are."
4226,Not necessarily...
4227,"Yes necessarily! I mean, I dunno what it is, maybe it's the Amish thing."
4228,"Um, I'm not actually Amish."
4229,Really? Then why are you like that?
4230,You by the door. In or out?
4231,In. 
4232,"You in the back, you're getting it all wrong!"
4233,"Yeah, but at least I'm doing it!"
4234,"This is the final boarding call for flight 67 to San Diego, boarding at gate 42A."
4235,"Okay. Goodbye, little monkey guy. Alright, I wrote you this poem. Okay, but don't eat it 'till you get on the 'plane."
4236,"Aww. Thank you, Aunt Phoebe."
4238,"Okay, bye, champ. Now, I know there's gonna be a lot of babes in San Diego, but remember, there's also a lot to learn."
4239,"I dunno what to say, Ross. Uh, it's a monkey."
4240,"Just, just say what you feel."
4241,"Marcel, I'm hungry."
4242,That was good.
4243,"Marcel, this is for you. It's, uh, just, y'know, something to, um, do on the 'plane."
4244,"Uh, if you guys don't mind, I'd like to take a moment, just me and him."
4245,"Oh, sure. Sure, absolutely. "
4246,"Marcel, c'mere, c'mere.  Well buddy, this is it. There's just a coupla things I want to say. I'm really gonna miss you, and I'm never gonna forget about you. You've been more than just a pet to me, you've been more like a be-  Okay, Marcel, please, could you leave my leg alone? Could you just stop humping me for two seconds?! Marcel, would- okay, just take him away. Just take him."
4247,"Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand, that I might... touch thy cheek..."
4248,"That's fine, thank you."
4249,Next. 
4250,"Hi, uh, I'll be reading for the role of Mercutio."
4251,Name?
4252,Holden McGroin.
4253,Tell him.
4255,"Tell him, tell him."
4256,Just...please tell him.
4258,Tell me what?
4259,"Look at you, you won't even look at him."
4260,"Oh, come on tell me. I could use another reason why women wonīt look at me."
4261,"All right, all right, all right. Last night, I had a dream that, uh, you and I, were..."
4262,Doing it on this table. 
4264,Exellent dream score.
4265,"Why, why, why would you dream that?"
4266,"More importantly, was I any good?"
4267,"Well, you were pretty damnedy good."
4268,"Interesting, cause in my dreams, Iīm allways surprisingly inadequate. "
4269,"Well, last night you seemed to know your way around the table."
4270,"I love it, when we share."
4271,Youīre okay there?
4272,I canīt belive you two had sex in her dream.
4273,"Iīm sorry, it was a one-time-thing. I was very drunk and i was somebody elseīs subconscious."
4274,Hi Rachel.
4275,Get off.
4276,"Uh, uh, gimme. Can you see me operating a drill press?"
4277,I donīt know. What are you wearing?
4278,"Phoebs, why would you want to operate a drill press?"
4279,"Just for some short-term-work. You know, until I get back some of my massage clients."
4280,Pirates again?
4281,"No, nothing like that. I was just...such a dummie. I taught this ""massage-yourself-at-home-workshop"". And they are."
4282,"Hey, hey, Chan. She could work for you."
4283,"Thanks Joey, thatīs a good idea."
4284,"What... I could, I could do it. What is it?"
4285,"Well, my secretary is gonna be out for a couple of weeks. She is having one of her boobs redused. Itīs a whole big boob story."
4286,I could be a secretary.
4287,"Well, you know Phoebs. I donīt know if itīs your kinda thing, because it involves a lot of being normal. For a large portion of the day."
4289,What are you playing with?
4290,"Oh, itīs my new beeper."
4291,What the hell does a paleontologist need a beeper for?
4292,"Is it like for dinosaur emergencies. 'Help, come quick, theyīre still extinct.'"
4293,"No, itīs for when Carol goes into labor. She can get me wherever I am. I mean, all she has to do is to dial 55-JIMBO."
4294,"A cool phone number, and a possible name for the kid."
4295,"All right, Iīll see you guys later. "
4296,Off to see young Ethan?
4298,How young is young Ethan? Young?
4299,Heīs... our age.
4300,When we were?
4301,"Okay, heīs a senior in college."
4302,College?
4303,Whoa!
4304,And this manchild has no problem with how old you are?
4305,"No, of course not. Itīs not even an issue. Cause I told him I was 22."
4307,"Oh, I canīt pass for 22?"
4308,"Well, maybe 25-26."
4309,I am 26.
4311,Can you hear that?
4313,See Thatīll stop when you pick up the phone.
4314,"Oh. Uh, Iīm on. "
4315,"Mr. Bingīs office. No Iīm sorry, heīs in a meeting right now."
4316,Iīm not in a meeting. Iīm right... Whoops.
4317,"Will he know what this is in reference to? And he has your number? All right, Iīll see that he gets the message. Bye bye."
4319,Ross says hi.
4320,Ah!
4321,"This is so fun. All right, what do we do now?"
4322,"Well, now, I actually have to get to work."
4323,"Most likely.  Okay, Iīm gonna be out there."
4325,All right. Bye bye.
4326,Bye bye.
4327,Whatcha doinī?
4328,Ooh. 
4329,"Windows are clean, candels are lit. Uh, beltīs to tight, gotta change the belt. Did i turn the fish?  No, cause I made lasagne. Am I out of control?"
4330,"Just a touch. Mon, I donīt understand. I mean, youīve been dating this guy since like, what... his midterms? I mean, why all the sudden are you so... Oh."
4332,Could tonight be the Night?
4333,"I donīt know. Look heīs a great guy and I love being with him but... you know. Things happen, and they happen. You donīt plan these things."
4334,"So, did you shave your legs?"
4336,Aha!
4337,Would you let it go Ross. It was just a dream. It doesnīt mean...
4338,"Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Oh this is it. Oh my god itīs baby time. Baby time."
4339,"All right, relax, relax. Just relax, just relax. Be cool, be cool."
4340,"Yeah, hi, I was just beeped.  No, André is not here.  Third time today.  Yes, Iīm sure... No, sir. I donīt perform those kind of services."
4341,"Services? Oh, services."
4342,"Yeah, you want 55-JUMBO. Yeah, thatīs right. Thatīs right, JUMBO with a U, sir.  No, belive me, you donīt want me. Judging by his number, Iīd be a huge disappointment.  All rightie, bye bye."
4343,"Hey, hey. How was the first day?"
4344,"Oh, exellent. Everyone was so, so nice."
4345,"See, it pays to know the man who wears my shoes.  Me."
4346,"No, I didnīt tell anybody that I knew you."
4348,"Oh, because, you know... they donīt like you."
4350,I thought you knew that.
4351,Noho. Why doesnīt they like me?
4352,Everyone. Except for uh... no everyone.
4353,What are you talking about?
4354,"Donīt feel bad. You know they used to like you a lot. But then you got promoted, and, you know, now youīre like ""Mr. Boss Man"". You know, Mr. Bing. Mr. Bing, ""Boss Man Bing""."
4355,I canīt belive it.
4356,"Yeah, yeah. They even do you."
4357,They do me?
4358,You know like... uh okay... uh... 'Could that report be any later?'
4359,I donīt sound like that.
4360,"Oh, oh Chandler..."
4361,"Oh... Yeah, you do."
4362,'The hills were alive with the sound of music.'
4363,My scones.
4364,'My scones.'
4365,"Okay, I donīt sound like that. That is so not true."
4366,"That is so not... That is so not... That... Oh, shut up!"
4367,Did not.
4368,"I am telling you, up until I was, like nine, I thought that g*n was an actual place wher crimes happen."
4369,How was that possible?
4370,"Well, think about it. Itīs always on the news. 'A man is being held up, at g*n.' 'Tourists are being terrorised, at g*n.' You know, I just kept thinking: why does people continue to go there? Oh, ah. I should go."
4373,Unless--
4375,"Uh, ah. Unless you wanna stay over? I mean, Iīm going to, so..."
4376,"Yeah, Iīd really like that."
4377,"Uuh, before we get into any staying-over-stuff, there is something you should know."
4378,"Okay, is this like 'I have an early class tomorrow' or 'Iīm secretly married to a goat'?"
4379,"Well itīs somewhere in between. You see, in a strictly technical sense, of course, Iīm not uh..., well I, I mean I havenīt ever uh..."
4380,Ethan--
4382,Are you a virgin?
4383,"Well, if thatīs what you kids are calling it these days then, yes I am. I uh, Iīve kinda been waiting for the right person."
4385,"Yeah. You do know I was talking about you, right?"
4387,You keep saying that.
4388,"You know, you read about it, you see it in the movies. Even when you practise it at home, man oh man, it is nothing like that."
4389,"Listen, uh, you told me something that was really difficult for you. And I, I-I figured if you could be honest, then I can to."
4390,"Oh god, donīt tell me, I did it wrong."
4391,No no. Nothing wrong about that. 
4393,"Um, okay, here it goes. Iīm not 22. Iīm, Iīm 25... and thirteen months. "
4395,"But I figured, you know, that shouldnīt change anything. I mean, what the hell does it matter how old we are."
4396,"Uh, listen um, as long as weīre telling stuff, uh, I have another one for you. Iīm a little younger than I said."
4397,Youīre not a senior?
4398,"Oh, Iīm a senior... in High School."
4399,Ok...ay.
4400,"What we did was wrong. Oh god, I just had sex with somebody that wasnīt alive during the Bicentennial."
4401,I just had sex.
4402,"Ethan, focus. How could you not tell me?"
4403,"Well, you never told me how old you were."
4404,"Well, thatīs different. My lie didnīt make one of us a felon in 48 states. What were you thinking?"
4405,I wasnīt thinking. I was too busy fallin'--
4406,Donīt say it. 
4407,--in love with you.
4409,Sorry.
4410,"Well,fall out of it. You know, you shouldnīt even be here, itīs a school night. Oh god, oh god. Iīm like those women that you see with shiny guys like Chad. Iīm Joan Collins."
4411,Who? 
4412,"Oh, come on. You told me about the last dream."
4413,"No, forget it."
4414,"Oh, why not. Was I doing anything particularly... saucy?"
4415,"All right, fine. Um, you were not the only one there.  Joey was there too."
4417,"Was there...uh, huh, huh, huh... andybody, anybody else there."
4419,"Youīre sure? Nobody uh, handed out uh, mints or anything?"
4420,"No, it was just the three of us."
4422,"So, tell me. Was it like you and Chandler, and then you and me, or you and me and Chandler?"
4423,"He, he, he. You know what?"
4425,There were times when it wasnīt even me.
4426,"That is so sweet, you guys. "
4427,"Hey, Mon."
4428,"Mon, Ethan called again. Mon?"
4429,Mon!
4431,Ethan called again.
4433,Are you not seeing him anymore?
4434,"No. You know, sometimes just things doesnīt work out."
4435,And this has nothing to do with the fact that he needs a note to get out of gym.
4436,"I, I didnīt say any... I sw... I did not say anything, I swear."
4437,"Listen, the next time you talk to him, can you ask him which one the strongest ""Power Ranger"" is?"
4439,"Ha,ha, ha, oh my life is just so amusing. Could we drop it now?"
4441,Itīs morphin time!
4442,Stegosaurus!
4443,Tyrannosaurus!
4444,"Ooh, oh, Iīve gotta go.  Whoa, oh, head rush. One more, and then I have to go.  Cool!"
4446,"Um, oh, Iīve got a birthday party, with some work people."
4447,Work people? Nobody told me.
4448,"No, I know. Thatīs a part of the whole, you know, them-not-liking-you-extravagance."
4449,"You know, I donīt get this. A month aga, these people were my friends. You know, just because Iīm in charge doesnīt mean iīm a different person."
4450,"Well, then you should come tonight. You know, just hang out with them. Let them see what a great guy you still are."
4451,You think I should?
4452,"I really do, yeah."
4456,"Oh, but, could we not go together? I,I donīt wanna be the geek that invited the boss."
4457,"I Think last night was great. You know, the Karaoke thing. Tracy and I doing ""Ebony and Ivory""."
4458,You were great. But they still made fun of you.
4460,"You know, now youīre more like, you know like, ""Mr. Caring Boss"", ""Mr."", you know, ""Iīm one of you, Boss"", ""Mr., I wanna be your buddy, Boss Man Bing"""
4461,"Then, I donīt get it."
4462,"Well, you know what Chandler? I think youīve gotta face it. Youīre like, the guy in the big office, you know. Youīre the one that hires them, that fires them... They still say youīre a great boss."
4463,They do?
4464,Uh huh. But theyīre not your friends anymore.
4465,I just wanīt to--
4466,"No, but you canīt."
4467,But I just wa--
4468,Uh uh.

4471,What about André?
4472,"Oh, welll this morning he got a call from who I think was our cousin Nathan, and frankly, it was a little more than I needed to know."
4474,That was gonna be my opener.
4475,"Hey, did you guys check out those new handdryers in the bathroom?"
4476,I thought that was just a rumour.
4477,True story.
4478,Theyīre here allready?
4479,"All right, look. Iīve gotta tell you something. Iīm not 17. I only said so that youīd think I was cute and vunerable. Iīm actually 30, I have a wife, I have a job, Iīm your congressman. Monica, this is ridiculous, weīre great together. We can talk , we make each other laugh, and the sex. Oh, man, okay i have no frame of graft, but I thought that was great."
4480,It was.
4481,"Then, whatīs the problem?"
4482,"Ethan, itīs um... itīs icky."
4483,Icky? Youīre actually gonna throw this away because itīs icky?
4484,"This isnīt easy for me either. I wish things were different, I... If you were a few years older, or if I was a few years younger, or if we lived in biblical times, I would really--"
4485,"No, donīt say it. "
4486,--love you.

4488,"Uh, moist, yeah."

4491,"Hello, Mr. Bing."
4492,"Loved your ""Stevie Wonder"" last night."
4493,"Thanks. Listen, about the weekly numbers, Iīm gonna need them on my desk by nine oīclock."
4495,No problem.
4496,"You have to give īem something, you know. Okay, now that was Gerston, Santos, and whoīs the guy with the moustache?"
4497,Petrie.
4498,"Petrie, right, right. Okay, somebodyīs gonna be working this weekend."

4514,What are you doing? Weīre going to a hospital.
4515,"What, so I canīt lokk nice? There might be doctors there."
4516,"Joey, get out of the fridge."
4517,"All right, all right. "
4518,What is that? 
4519,For the ride.
4520,"Yeah, like in a cab--"

4528,"Rossy, Rossy."
4529,She's not here yet. She's not here. She's having my baby and she's not here.
4530,I'm sure everything's fine. Has her water broke yet?
4531,"I don't know, but when I spoke to her, she said she had already passed the mucus plug."
4532,Do we have to know about that?
4533,"Joey, what are you gonna do when you have a baby?"
4534,"I'm gonna be in the waitin' room, handing out cigars."
4535,"Yes, Joey's made arrangements to have his baby in a movie from the 50's."
4536,"God, I don't believe this. She could be giving birth in the cab."
4537,"Oh, Ross, relax. It's probably like two dollars for the first contraction, and then fifty cents for each additional contraction."
4538,"What, it's ok when Chandler does it?"
4539,You have to pick your moments.
4540,"Did I miss it, did I miss it?"
4541,She's not even here yet.
4542,What's with the guitar?
4543,"I just thought we might be here for awhile. You know, things might get musical."
4544,Where the hell have you been?
4545,We stopped at the gift shop.
4546,"I was looking at stuffed animals, and Susan wanted a Chunky."
4547,"Susan wanted a Chunky. We're having a baby, ok, a baby, you don't stop for Chunkys."
4548,I used to have that bumper sticker.
4549,You see what I mean.
4550,Stopped for a Chunky.
4551,"Let it go, Ross."
4552,I got an extra one. You want this? 
4554,"Hey, how's my favorite parenting team doing?"
4555,"Dr. Franzblau, hi."
4556,"So, I understand you're thinking of having a baby? Well, I see you're nine months pregnant. That's a good start. How you doing with your contractions?"
4557,"Oh, I love them. Each one's like a little party in my uterus."
4558,They're every four minutes and last 55 seconds.
4559,"59 seconds.  Quartz, ha."
4560,"Swiss quartz, ha, ha."
4561,Am I allowed to drink anything?
4562,"Ice chips, just ice chips. They're at the nurses' station."
4563,I'll get it.
4564,"No, I'm getting it. I'll be right back."
4565,I got it--I'm getting it!
4566,"Hi, I thought you might like some ice chips."
4568,"And if you need anything else, I----do not believe we've met. Hi. I'm, uh, Rachel Green. I'm Carol's... ex-husband's... sister's roommate."
4569,It is nice to meet you. I'm Dr. Franzblau. I'm your roommate's... brother's... ex-wife's obstetrician.
4570,"Oh, that's funny!"
4571,I want a baby.
4572,"Mmmm. Not tonight, honey. I got an early day tomorrow."
4573,Get up. Come on. Let's get some coffee.
4574,"Oh, ok, 'cause we never do that."
4575,"sh**t! sh**t! sh**t! sh**t, or just fall down. That's good too."
4576,Knick fan?
4578,"Oh, boy, do they suck."
4579,"Hey, listen, lady.......whoa."
4580,"Look, look at your man, Ewing. Nice sh*t. You know what, he couldn't hit water if he was standing on a boat."
4581,Oh yeah? And who do you like?
4582,The Celtics.
4583,"The Celtics? Ha. They couldn't hit a boat if...wait. They suck, alright?"
4584,"Oh, shut up. You know, it's a rebuilding year. You... waah!"
4585,"Wha? Wha..aa? Let me get the father. Hey, we need a father over here! We need a father!"
4586,There is no father.
4587,"Oh, oh, oh, sorry."
4588,"Ok, that's ok. I'm fine. I'm... oh!"
4589,"Oh, uh, ok. Right this way. All the other pregnant women seem to be goin' in here."
4591,"They're tiny and chubby and so sweet to touch, and soon they'll grow up and resent you so much. Now they're yelling at you and you don't know why, you cry and you cry and you cry. And you cry and you cry and you cry..."
4592,"Thanks, Ross."
4593,Yeah. I'm paying you to stop.
4595,"Oh, look, twins. Hi, guys. Oh, cute, cute."
4596,No fair. I don't even have one. How come they get two?
4597,You'll get one.
4598,Oh yeah? When?
4599,"All right. I'll tell you what. When we're 40, if neither one of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?"
4600,Why won't I be married when I'm 40?
4601,"Oh, no, no. I just meant hypothetically."
4602,"Ok, hypothetically, why won't I be married when I'm 40?"
4603,"No, no, no."
4604,What is it? Is there something fundamentally unmarriable about me?
4605,"Uh, uh."
4607,Dear God! This parachute is a knapsack! 
4609,"Hey. Ooh, look at you, dressy-dress."
4610,Did you go home and change?
4611,"Yeah, well, it's an important day. I wanna look nice. Um, has uh Dr. Franzblau been by?"
4612,"No, I haven't seen him."
4613,"Well, where is he? He is supposed to be here. What if the baby needs him?"
4614,"Rachel, what is the deal with you and doctors, anyway? Was, like, your father a doctor?"
4615,"Yeah, why?"
4616,No reason. 
4617,"Mom, we've been through this. No, I'm not calling him. I don't care if it is his kid, the guy's a jerk. No, I'm not alone. Joey's here.  What do you mean, Joey who?  Joey who?"
4618,Tribbiani.
4619,"Joey Tribbiani. Yes, ok. Hold on.  She wants to talk to you. Take the phone."
4620,"Hi, yeah, it's me. Oh, no no no, we're just friends.  Yeah, I'm single.  25. An actor.  Hello?"
4621,She's not much of a phone person.
4622,"Yeah, so, uh, so, uh, what's the deal with this father guy, I mean, if someone was havin' my baby somewhere, I'd wanna know about it, you know?"
4623,"Hey, Knick fan, am I interested in your views on fatherhood? Uh, no."
4624,"Ok, look, maybe I should just go."
4625,Maybe you should.
4626,"Good luck, and uh, take care, huh?"
4627,You know what the Celtics problem is? They let the players run the team.
4628,"Oh, that is so not true."
4629,"Oh, it is."
4630,It isn't.
4631,It is.
4632,Isn't!
4633,Breathe.
4639,You're gonna k*ll me!
4640,"15 more seconds, 14, 13, 12..."
4641,Count faster.
4642,"It's gonna be ok, just remember, we're doing this for Jordie. Just keep focusing on Jordie."
4643,Who the hell is Jordie?
4644,Your son.
4645,"No no no. I don't have a son named Jordie. We all agreed, my son's name is Jamie."
4646,"Well, Jamie was the name of Susan's first girlfriend, so we went back to Jordie."
4647,"What? Whoa, whoa whoa whoa, what do you mean, back to Jordie? We never landed on Jordie. We just passed by it during the whole Jessy, Cody, Dylan fiasco."
4648,"Ow, ow, ow, ow, leg cramp, leg cramp, leg cramp."
4649,I got it.
4651,"I got it! Hey, you get to sleep with her, I get the cramps."
4652,"No, you don't."
4653,"All right, that's it. I want both of you out."
4655,He started it!
4656,"No, you started it."
4657,You did!
4658,"I don't care. I am trying to get a person out of my body here, and you're not making it any easier."
4659,But--
4660,Now go!
4661,Thanks a lot.
4662,See what you did.
4663,"Yeah, listen--"
4664,OUT!
4665,"Breathe, breathe, breathe..."
4666,"Oh, no."
4667,Ew! What is that? Something exploded!
4668,"It's just her water breaking. Calm down, will you?"
4669,"Water breaking, what do you mean? What's that, water breaking?"
4670,"Breathe, breathe, breathe."
4671,Please. This is so your fault.
4672,"How, how is this my fault?"
4673,"Look, Carol never threw me out of a room before you came along."
4674,"Yeah? Well, there's a lot of things Carol never did before I came along."
4675,You tryin' to be clever? A funny lady?
4676,You know what your problem is? You're threatened by me.
4677,"Oh, I'm threatened by you?"
4679,"Hey, hey, ok, all right, that's it! Get in here. Come on. My god, you guys, I don't believe you. There are children coming into the world in this very building and your negative fighting noises are not the first thing they should be hearing. So just stop all the yelling, just stop it!"
4680,"Yeah, Susan."
4681,"Don't make me do this again, I don't like my voice like this."
4682,"Ok, who wants to hear something ironic?"
4683,Help!
4684,"I'm having a baby in here! Ok, everyone stand back.  Ow."
4685,Are they here yet?
4686,"No, honey, they're not, but don't worry, because we are going to find them, and until we do, we are all here for you, ok?"
4688,Ok?
4690,"Ok, so anyway, you were telling me about Paris, it sounds fascinating."
4691,"It really was. There was this great little pastry shop right by my hotel.  There you go, dear."
4692,"Come on, Lydia, you can do it. Push! Push 'em out, push 'em out, harder, harder. Push 'em out, push 'em out, way out! Let's get that ball and really move, hey, hey, ho, ho. Let's--  I was just--yeah, right. Push! Push!"
4693,"What're you gonna do, suck the door open?"
4694,Help! Help!
4695,"They found their bodies the very next day, they found their bodies the very next... la la la la la la."
4697,Where have you been?
4698,"Oh, just had a baby."
4699,Mazel tov!
4700,"I don't know, could be an hour, could be three, but relax, she's doing great. So, uh, tell me, are you currently involved with anyone?"
4701,"No, no, not at the moment, no, I'm not. Are you?"
4702,"No, it's hard enough to get women to go out with me."
4703,"Right, yeah, I've heard that about cute doctors."
4704,"No, no, really. I suppose it's because I spend so much time, you know, where I do."
4706,"I try not to let my work affect my personal life, but it's hard, when you... do what I do. It's like uh...Well, for instance, what do you do?"
4707,I'm a waitress.
4708,"Ok, all right, well aren't there times when you come home at the end of the day, and you're just like, 'if I see one more cup of coffee'..."
4709,Yeah. Gotcha.
4710,I'm gonna go check up on your friend.
4711,Ok. That's fine. 
4712,So how did you know I was even here?
4713,Your mom called me. So is this her?
4714,"No, this is a loaner."
4715,I'm sorry you had to do this by yourself.
4716,"I wasn't by myself. I had a doctor, a nurse, and a helper guy.  So, did you see who won the game?"
4717,"Yeah, the Knicks by 10. They suck."
4718,"Yeah, they're not so bad."
4719,"Come on, come on. Damnit, damnit, damnit, damnit.  This is all your fault. This is supposed to be, like, the greatest day of my life, y'know? My son is being born, and I should be in there, you know, instead of stuck in a closet with you."
4720,The woman I love is having a baby today. I've been waiting for this just as much as you have.
4721,"No no no, believe me. No one has been waiting for this as much as I have, ok? And you know what the funny thing is? When this day is over, you get to go home with the baby, ok? Where does that leave me?"
4722,"You get to be the baby's father. Everyone knows who you are. Who am I? There's Mother's Day, there's Father's Day, there's no... Lesbian Lover Day."
4723,Every day is Lesbian Lover Day.
4724,This is so great.
4725,You wanna explain that?
4726,"I mean, well, 'cause when I was growing up, you know my dad left, and my mother d*ed, and my stepfather went to jail, so I barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one. And here's this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they're fighting over who gets to love it the most. And it's not even born yet. It's just, it's just the luckiest baby in the whole world.  I'm sorry, you were fighting."
4727,Where are they?
4728,I'm sure they'll be here soon.
4729,"Yeah, honey, they wouldn't miss this."
4730,Relax. You're only at nine centimeters. And the baby's at zero station.
4731,You are really frightening me.
4732,"Somebody wanna help me, tryin' to rip out my heart.  Uh, that's great.  Anybody seen a nipple?"
4733,"All right, ten centimeters, here we go."
4734,"All right, honey, time to start pushing."
4735,But they're not here yet!
4736,"I'm sorry, I can't tell the baby to wait for them."
4737,"Oh, god."
4738,"Ok, got the vent open."
4739,"Hi, I'm Ben. I'm hospital worker Ben. It's Ben... to the rescue!"
4740,"Ben, you ready? All right, gimme your foot. Ok, on three, Ben. One, two, three. Ok, That's it, Ben."
4741,What do you see?
4742,"Well, Susan, I see what appears to be a dark vent. Wait. Yes, it is in fact a dark vent."
4743,"Phoebs, It's open! It's open!"
4744,Wait! You forgot your legs!
4745,"Push, push!"
4746,We're here!
4748,"Long story, honey."
4749,"All right, Carol, I need you to keep pushing. I need-- Excuse me, could I have this?"
4750,"All right, all right, there's a few too many people in this room, and there's about to be one more, so anybody who's not an ex-husband or a lesbian life partner, out you go!"
4751,Good luck!
4752,"Let me ask you, do you have to be Carol's lesbian life partner?"
4753,Out!
4754,"All right, he's crowning. Here he comes."
4755,"Let me see, I gotta see, I gotta see. Oh, a head. Oh, it's, it's huge. Carol, how are you doing this?"
4756,Not.... helping!
4757,"You're doing great, you're doing fine."
4758,"Hello!  Oh, sorry."
4759,What do you see? What do you see?
4760,"We got a head, we got shoulders, we got arms, we got, oh, look at the little fingers, oh, and a chest, and a stomach. It's a boy, definitely a boy! All right! Ok, legs, knees, and feet. Oh, oh. He's here. He's a person."
4761,"Oh, look at that."
4762,What does he look like?
4763,"Kinda like my uncle Ed, covered in Jello."
4765,"You guys, he's beautiful!"
4766,"Oh, thanks, Pheebs!"
4767,"No shouting, but we still need a name for this little guy."
4768,How 'bout Ben?
4769,I like Ben.
4770,Ben. Ben. Ben's good. How come you never mentioned Ben before?
4771,"We uh, we just cooked it up."
4772,That's what we were off doing.
4775,Can we come in?
4776,"I know, I know. Everybody, there's someone I'd like you to meet. Yeah. This is Ben. Ben, this is everybody."
4777,"Susan, he looks just like you."
4779,"Oh, god, I can't believe one of us actually has one of these."
4780,"I know, I still am one of these."
4781,"Ross, can I?"
4782,"The head, the head. You gotta..."
4783,"Hi, Ben. Hi. I'm your Aunt Monica. Yes I am. I'm your Aunt Monica. I...I will always have gum."
4784,"Ben, I want you to know that there may be some times when I may not be around, like this.  But I'll still always come back, like this.  And sometimes I may be away longer, like this.  But I'll still always come back, like this. "
4785,"And sometimes, I'll want you to steal third, and I'll go like this."
4786,He is so amazing.
4787,"Oh, I know. Look at him."
4788,"Ben, Ben, hey Ben. Nothing. I don't think that's his name."
4789,"Oh, look, look, he's closing his eyes.  Look, he's opening his eyes. "
4790,"He doesn't do much, does he?"
4791,"No, this is pretty much it."
4792,You guys wanna get some coffee?
4794,"All right, I'll see you guys later."
4795,"Oh, look, he's closing his eyes again."
4796,And here's little Ben nodding off...
4797,"Awww, look at Aunt Monica's little boy!"
4798,"Oh, look, he's got Ross's haircut!"
4799,"Oh, let me see!  Oh, God, is he just the sweetest thing? You must just want to kiss him all over!"
4800,That would be nice.
4801,Pardon?
4802,"Nothing, just a little extra air in my mouth. Pffft. Pffffffft. "
4803,"Hey, Chan, can you help me out here? I promise I'll pay you back."
4804,"Oh, yeah, right, OK... inlcuding the waffles last week, you now owe me... 17 jillion dollars."
4805,"I will, really. I'll pay you back this time."
4806,... And where's this money coming from? 
4807,Well... I'm helping out down at the NYU Med School with some... research.
4808,What kind of research?
4809,"Oh, just, y'know.... science."
4810,"Science. Yeah, I think I've heard of that. "
4811,... It's a fertility study.
4812,"Oh, Joey, please tell me you're only donating your time."
4813,"Alright, come on you guys, it's not that big a deal. Really... I mean, I just go down there every other day and... make my contribution to the project. Hey, hey, but at the end of two weeks, I get seven hundred dollars."
4815,"Wow, ooh, you're gonna be making money hand over fist!"
4816,"OK, we got the cole slaw, we got the buns..."
4817,"We've got the ground-up flesh of formerly cute cows and turkeys, ew... "
4818,Men are here.
4819,We make fire. Cook meat.
4820,"Then put out fire by peeing, no get invited back."
4821,Ewww!
4822,"Oh Joey, Melanie called, said she's gonna be late."
4823,"Oh, OK."
4824,So how are things going with you two? Is she becoming your  special someone?
4825,"I don't know, she's, uh.... she's pretty great."
4826,Yeah? What does she think of your little science project?
4827,"What, you think I'm gonna tell a girl I like that I'm also seeing a cup?"
4828,Man's got a point.
4829,"Well, the tough thing is, she really wants to have sex with me."
4830,Crazy bitch.
4831,"Yeah, well, I still got a week left to go in the program, and according to the rules, if I want to get the money I'm not allowed to conduct any... ersonal experiments, if you know what I mean."
4832,Joey... we always know what you mean.
4836,How long did you think this barbecue was gonna last?
4837,I'm going to China.
4838,"Jeez, you say one thing, and..."
4839,You're going to China?
4840,"Yeah, i-it's for the museum. Someone found a bone, we want the bone, but they don't want us to have the bone, so I'm going over there to try to persuade them to give us the bo--it's--it's a whole big bone thing. Anyway, I'm gonna be gone for like, uh... like a week, so, uh, if you wanna reach me, y-you can't. So here's my itinerary . Um... here's a picture of me... "
4841,"Oh, let me see! "
4842,": Could you take it to Carol's every now and then, and show it to Ben, just so he doesn't forget me?"
4844,"Hi, Ben. I'm your father. I am... the head. Aaaaaahhhh....  Alright, this barbecue is gonna be very fun."
4845,"Hey, is Rachel here? Um, I wanted to wish her a happy birthday before I left."
4846,"Oh no, she's out having drinks with Carl."
4847,"Oh.  Hey, who's Carl?"
4848,"You know, that guy she met at the coffeehouse."
4850,"Oh, well, see, there's this guy she met at the--"
4851,"At the coffeehouse, right."
4852,So you do know who he is!  Sorry.
4853,"OK, I'm gonna go say goodbye to the guys."
4854,"Oh, hey, y'know what? Tell them that bone story."
4858,....I have to go to China.
4859,The country?
4860,"No no, this big pile of dishes in my mom's breakfront. Do you guys know who Carl is?"
4861,"Uh, let's see... Alvin... Simon... Theodore.... no."
4862,"Well, Rachel's having drinks with him tonight."
4863,Oh no! How can she do that when she's never shown any interest in you?!?
4864,Forget about her.
4865,"He's right, man. Please. Move on. Go to China. Eat Chinese food."
4866,"Course there, they just call it food."
4867,"Yeah... I guess. I don't--I don't know. Alright, just... just give her this for me, OK? "
4868,"Listen, buddy, we're just looking out for you."
4870,"We want you to be happy. And I may only have a couple beers in me, but... I love you, man. "
4871,I'm still on my first. I just think you're nice.
4872,"Anyway, that's when me and my friends started this whole fruit basket business. We call ourselves 'The Three Basketeers.'"
4873,"Like the three musketeers, only with fruit."
4874,Ooooh. 
4875,"OK, how does everybody like their burgers?"
4876,"Oh, no, no, no. Presents first. Food later. "
4877,"Hey, hold on there, tiger. How's it going? How you holding up?"
4878,"Well, not so good. She definitely thinks tonight is the night we're gonna... complete the transaction, if you know what I--"
4879,"Then you do. Heh, heh."
4880,"So, uh, have you ever thought about being there for her?"
4882,"Y'know, just be there for her."
4883,Not following you.
4884,Think about it.
4885,"OK, I'm guessing this is from..."
4886,"Well, thank you, Melanie."
4887,"OK, this one right here is from me."
4888,"OK... ah, it's light... ...it rattles... it's...  Travel Scrabble! Oooohhh, thank you! "
4889,This one's from Joey... feels like a book. Thinks it's a book... feels like a book. And......it's a book!
4890,"Oh, it's Dr. Seuss!"
4891,: That book got me through some tough times.
4892,There is a little child inside this man!
4893,"Yes, the doctors say if they remove it, he'll die."
4894,Who's this from?
4895,"Oh, that's Ross's."
4896,Oh... ...  Oh my God. He remembered.
4897,Remembered what?
4898,"It was like months ago. We were walking by this antique store, and I saw this pin in the window, and I told him it was just like one my grandmother had when I was a little girl. Oh! I can't believe he remembered!"
4899,"Well, sure, but can you play it on a plane? "
4900,"Oh, it's so pretty. This must have cost him a fortune."
4901,I can't believe he did this.
4902,"Come on, Ross? Remember back in college, when he fell in love with Carol and bought her that ridiculously expensive crystal duck?"
4903,What did you just say?
4904,ahem... um... Crystal duck.
4905,"No, no, no.... the, um, the... 'love' part?"
4906,F-hah.... flennin....
4907,Oh.... my God.
4908,"Oh, no no no no no...."
4909,"That's good, just keep rubbing your head. That'll turn back time."
4910,"I mean, this is unbelievable."
4911,"I know. This is really, really huge."
4912,No it's not. It's small. It's tiny. It's petite. It's wee.
4913,Nuh-uh. I don't think any of our lives are ever gonna be the same ever again.
4914,"OK, is there a mute button on this woman?"
4915,"I think this is so great! I mean, you and Ross! D-did you have any idea?"
4916,"No! None! I mean, my first night in the city, he mentioned something about asking me out, but nothing ever happened, so I just... : W-well, what else did he say? I mean, does he, like, want to go out with me?"
4917,"Well, given that he's desperately in love with you, he probably wouldn't mind getting a cup of coffee or something."
4918,"Ross? All this time? Well, I've got to talk to him. "
4919,H-He's in China!
4920,The country.
4921,"No, no, wait.  His flight doesn't leave for another forty-five more minutes."
4922,What about the time difference?
4923,From here to the airport?
4924,Yes!  You're never gonna make it!
4925,"Rachel, what're you gonna say to him?"
4926,I-I-I don't know.
4927,Well then maybe you shouldn't go.
4928,"He's right, cause if you're just gonna, like, break his heart, that's the kind of thing that can wait."
4929,"Yeah, but if it's good news, you should tell him now."
4930,I don't know. Maybe I'll know when I see him.
4931,"Here, look, alright, does this help?"
4932,"Noooo... look, all I know is that I cannot wait a week until I see him. I mean, this is just too big. Y'know, I just, I've just gotta talk to him. I... I gotta... OK, I'll see you later. "
4933,"Rachel, I love you! Deal with me first! "
4934,Alright!
4935,Ni-chou chi-ma! 
4936,"Ross! Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me...."
4939,May I see your boarding pass?
4940,"Oh, no, no, I don't have one. I just need to talk to my friend."
4941,"Oh, oooh. I'm sorry. You are not allowed on the jetway unless you have a boarding pass."
4942,"No, I know, but I--he just went on. He's right there, he's got the blue jacket on, I... can I j-just..."
4943,No no no! Federal regulations!
4944,"OK, alright, OK, um... then could you please, uh... just give him a message for me? Please? This is very important."
4945,Alright. What's the message?
4946,Uh... I don't know.
4947,"Sir? Sir? Excuse me, sir? Uh... I have a message for you."
4949,"It's from Rachel. She said that she loved the present, and she will see you when you get back."
4950,": Toby... Oh, for God's sake, I don't know what she's talking about! There's no Rachel! Don't give me that deep freeze."
4951,"Mmmmmm... Oh, Joey, Joey, Joey... I think I blacked out there for a minute!"
4952,"Heh, heh. It was nothin'."
4953,"Well, now we've gotta find something fun for you! "
4954,"Uhhh.. y'know what? Forget about me. Let's, uh... let's give you another turn."
4955,M-Me again?
4956,Sure! Why not?
4957,"Boy, somebody's gonna get a big fruit basket tomorrow."
4958,"Oooh, I gotta tell you... you are nothing like I thought you would be."
4959,How do you mean?
4960,"I don't know, I-I guess I just had you pegged as one of those guys who're always 'me, me, me.' But you... you're a giver. You're like the most generous man I ever met. I mean... you're practically a woman."
4961,"Uh, so, uh, Rach, uh... do you wanna save this wrapping paper, I mean, it's only a little bit torn... so are you gonna go for it with Ross or should I just throw it out?"
4962,"I don't know. I don't know... I thought about it all the way there, and I thought about it all the way back... and, uh, oh, you guys, y'know, it's Ross. Y'know what I mean? I mean, it's Ross."
4964,"I don't know, I mean, this is just my initial gut feeling... but I'm thinking... oh, I'm thinking it'd be really great."
4965,"Oh my God, me too! Oh! Oh, we'd be like friends-in-law! Y'know what the best part is? The best part is that you already know everything about him! I mean, it's like starting on the fifteenth date!"
4966,"Yeah, but, y'know, it's... it would be like starting on the fifteenth date."
4967,Another good point.
4968,"No, I mean, I mean, when you're at the fifteenth date, y'know, you're already in a very relationshippy place. Y'know, it's... you're committed."
4970,"Well, I mean, then what happens if it doesn't work out?"
4971,Why isn't it working out?
4972,I don't know... sometimes it doesn't.
4973,Is he not cute enough for you?
4975,Does he not make enough money?
4976,"No, I'm just...."
4977,Maybe there's someone else.
4978,Wha--
4979,Is there? Is there someone else?
4980,No! There is.. there is noone else!
4981,Then why the hell are you dumping my brother?!?
4982,"Hey, big--"
4984,--spender.
4985,She's still asleep.
4987,"Oh, it was amazing. You know how you always think you're great in bed?"
4988,The fact that you'd even ask that question shows how little you know me.
4989,"Well, it's like, last night, I couldn't do the thing that usually makes me great. So I had to do all this other stuff. And the response I got... man, oh man, it was like a ticker tape parade!"
4990,"Yes, I know, as it happens my room is very very close to the parade route."
4991,"It was amazing! And not just for her... uh-uh. For me, too. It's like, all of a sudden, I'm blind. But all my other senses are heightened, y'know? It's like... I was able to appreciate it on another level."
4992,I didn't know you had another level.
4993,I know! Neither did I!
4994,"Hey, great skirt! Birthday present?"
4996,"Oh, from who?"
4997,From you. I exchanged the blouse you got me.
4998,"Well, it's the thought. Hey, doesn't Ross's flight get in in a couple hours? At gate 27-B?"
4999,"Uh, yeah. Uh, Monica, y'know, honey, I've been thinking about it and I've decided this--this whole Ross thing, it's just not a good idea."
5000,"Oh, why?"
5001,"Because, I feel like I wouldn't just be going out with him. I would be going out with all of you. Oh, and there would just be all this pressure, and I don't wanna--"
5002,"No, no, no, no, no, no pressure, no pressure!"
5003,"Monica, nothing has even happened yet, and you're already so..."
5004,"I am not 'so'! OK, I was a teensy bit weird at first, but... I'll be good. I promise."
5005,Who is it?
5006,"It's me, Carl."
5008,Behind my brother's back?  ... is exactly the kind of crazy thing you won't be hearing from me.
5009,Seven hundred bucks!
5010,"Alright, you did it! Do we have any fruit?"
5011,"Man, hell of a two weeks, huh? Y'know what, though? I really feel like I learned something."
5012,"Really? So, you're gonna stick with this 'it's all for her' thing?"
5013,"What, are you crazy? When a blind man gets his sight back, does he walk around like this? "
5014,"I'm just sayin', if I see one more picture of Ed Begley, Jr. in that stupid electric car, I'm gonna sh**t myself! I mean, don't get me wrong... I'm not against environmental issues per se.... it's just that guy!"
5015,I can't believe you'd rather go out with him than me.
5016,"Would you excuse me, please? I'm trying to have a date here."
5017,"Fine, just stop thinking about me."
5018,"Can't do it, can you?"
5019,So I'm thinking about you. So what?
5020,"I don't get it. What do you see in this guy, anyway?"
5021,Well... he happens to be a very nice... guy....
5022,"I mean, come on, buddy, get a real car!"
5023,"Rachel, come on. Give us a chance."
5024,"Ross, it's too hard."
5025,"No, no, no... why, because it might get weird for everyone else? Who cares about them. This is about us. Look, I-I've been in love with you since, like, the ninth grade."
5026,"Ross, you're like my best friend."
5028,"If we broke up, and I lost you..."
5029,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What makes you think we're gonna break up?"
5030,"Well, have you been involved with someone where you haven't broken up?"
5031,"No. But... it only has to happen once. Look, you and I both know we are perfect for each other, right? I mean... so, the only question is... are you attracted to me?"
5032,"I don't know... I mean, I've never looked at you that way before."
5033,"Well, start looking."
5035,Exactly! And you just know I'm gonna be the guy caught behind this hammerhead in traffic!
5036,Right! You're right!
5037,Heh... y'know?
5040,"I forgot... I am supposed to pick up a friend at the airport. I am so sorry! I'm so... if you want to stay, and finish your drinks, please do....  I mean--I'm sorry. I-I-I gotta go. I'm sorry."
5041,But...
5042,"Excuse me, pardon me, excuse me, excuse me, sorry. Hi."
5043,"For God's sake, will you let it go? There's no Rachel!"
5044,"Oh, hey, hey, I got that."
5045,"Oh, thanks, sweetie."
5046,No problem. I cannot wait for you to meet my friends.
5049,You don't think they'll judge and ridicule me?
5050,"No, no, they will. I just... uh..."
5051,Can't wait.
5052,"Come on, they're gonna love you."

5056,"Terry, I, I, I know that I haven't worked here very long, but I was wondering, do you think it would be possible if I got a $100 advance in my salary?"
5057,An advance?
5058,"It's so that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family. See, every year we go skiing in Vail, and normally my father pays for my ticket, but I sort of started the whole independence thing, you know, which is actually why I took this job."
5059,"Rachel, Rachel, sweetheart. You're a terrible, terrible waitress. Really, really awful."
5060,"Ok, I, I hear what you're sayin'. I'm with you. Um, but I, but I'm trying really hard. And I think I'm doing better. I really do. Does anybody need coffee?  Oh, look at that."
5061,"Excuse me, sir. Hi, you come in here all time. I was just wondering, do you think there's a possibility that you could give me an advance on my tips?"
5063,"Ok, ok, that's fine. Fine. Hey, I'm sorry about that spill before.  Only $98.50 to go."
5064,"Hey. Ross, did you know Mom and Dad are going to Puerto Rico for Thanksgiving?"
5065,"No, they're not."
5066,"Yes, they are. The Blymens invited them."
5067,You're wrong.
5068,I am not wrong.
5070,"No, I just talked to them."
5071,I'm calling Mom.
5072,"Hey, hey."
5075,And this from the cry-for-help department. Are you wearing makeup?
5076,"Yes, I am. As of today, I am officially Joey Tribbiani, actor slash model."
5077,"That's so funny, 'cause I was thinking you look more like Joey Tribbiani, man slash woman."
5078,What were you modeling for?
5079,You know those posters for the city free clinic?
5080,"Oh, wow, so you're gonna be one of those ""healthy, healthy, healthy guys""?"
5081,"You know, the asthma guy was really cute."
5082,Do you know which one you're gonna be?
5083,"No, but I hear lyme disease is open, so... "
5084,"Good luck, man. I hope you get it."
5086,"Well, you were right. How can they do this to us, huh? It's Thanksgiving."
5087,"Ok, I'll tell you what. How about I cook dinner at my place? I'll make it just like Mom's."
5088,Will you make the mashed potatoes with the lumps?
5089,"You know, they're not actually supposed to have...  I'll work on the lumps. Joey, you're going home, right?"
5091,"And I assume, Chandler, you are still boycotting all the pilgrim holidays."
5092,"Yes, every single one of them."
5093,"Phoebe, you're gonna be with your grandma?"
5094,"Yes, and her boyfriend. But we're celebrating Thanksgiving in December 'cause he is lunar."
5095,"So you're free Thursday, then."
5096,"Yeah. Oh, can I come?"
5097,"Yeah. Rach, are you thinking you're gonna make it to Vail?"
5098,"Absolutely. Shoop, shoop, shoop. Only a hundred and two dollars to go."
5099,I thought it was $98.50.
5100,"Yeah, well it was. I, I broke a cup."
5101,"Well, I'm off to Carol's."
5102,"Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?"
5103,"Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner."
5104,"Hi, is uh, is Carol here?"
5105,"No, she's at a faculty meeting."
5106,"Oh, I uh, just came by to pick up my skull. Well, not mine, but...Susan: Come in."
5107,"Thanks. Yeah, Carol borrowed it for a class, and I have to get it back to the museum."
5108,What's it look like?
5109,Kinda like a big face without skin.
5110,"Yes, I'm familiar with the concept. We can just look for it."
5111,"Ok.  Wow, you guys sure have a lot of books about bein' a lesbian."
5112,"Well, you know, you have to take a course. Otherwise, they don't let you do it."
5113,"Hey, hey, Yertle the Turtle. A classic."
5114,"Actually, I'm reading it to the baby."
5115,"The uh, the baby that hasn't been born yet? Wouldn't that mean you're... crazy?"
5116,"What, you don't think they can hear sounds in there?"
5117,"You're not serious, I mean, you really... you really talk to it?"
5118,"Yeah, all the time. I want the baby to know my voice."
5119,"Do you uh, do you talk about me?"
5120,"Yeah, yeah, all the time."
5122,"But um, we just refer to you as Bobo the Sperm Guy."
5123,"Look, if she's talking to it, I just think that I should get some belly time too. Not that I believe any of this."
5124,"Oh, I believe it. I think the baby can totally hear everything. I can show you. Look, this will seem a little weird, but you put your head inside this turkey, and then we'll all talk, and you'll hear everything we say."
5125,"I'd just like to say that I'm totally behind this experiment. In fact, I'd very much like to butter your head."
5126,"Hey, Rach, did you make your money?"
5127,"No, not even close. Forget Vail, forget seeing my family, forget shoop, shoop, shoop."
5128,"Rach, here's your mail."
5129,"Thanks, you can just put it on the table."
5130,"No, here's your mail."
5132,Would you just open it?
5133,"Oh my god, oh, you guys are great."
5134,We all chipped in.
5135,We did?
5136,You owe me 20 bucks.
5137,Thank you. Thank you so much!
5138,"Chandler, here you go, got your traditional Thanksgiving feast, you got your tomato soup, your grilled cheese fixin's, and your family size bag of Funyuns."
5139,"Wait, wait, Chandler, this is what you're havin' for Thanksgiving dinner? What, what, what is it with you and this holiday?"
5140,"All right, I'm nine years old."
5141,"Oh, I hate this story."
5142,"We just finished this magnificent Thanksgiving dinner. I have--and I remember this part vividly--a mouthful of pumpkin pie, and this is the moment my parents choose to tell me they're getting divorced."
5144,Yes. It's very difficult to appreciate a Thanksgiving dinner once you've seen it in reverse.
5145,"Uh, hi. We uh, we used to work together."
5147,"Yeah, at Macy's. You were the Obsession girl, right? I was the Aramis guy.  Aramis? Aramis?"
5149,I gotta tell you. You're the best in the business.
5150,Get out.
5151,"I'm serious. You're amazing. You know when to spritz, when to lay back."
5152,Really? You don't know what that means to me.
5153,"Ooh, you smell great tonight. What're you wearing?"
5155,"Listen, uh, you wanna go get a drink or something?"
5156,Yeah.  Oh.
5157,What's wrong?
5158,"I just remembered, I have to do something."
5159,Oh. What?
5160,"Um, leave."
5161,"Wait, wait, wait!"
5162,So I guess you all saw it.
5163,Saw what?
5164,"No, we were just laughing. You know, how laughter can be infectious."
5165,Set another place for Thanksgiving. My entire family thinks I have VD.
5166,"Tonight, on a very special Blossom."
5167,"Mmm, looking good. Ok, cider's mulling, turkey's turking, yams are yamming.  What?"
5168,I don't know. It's just not the same without Mom in the kitchen.
5169,"All right, that's it. You know what? Just get out of my way and stop moping."
5170,That's closer.
5171,"I got the tickets! I got the tickets! Five hours from now, shoop, shoop, shoop."
5172,"Oh, you must stop shooping."
5173,"Ok, I'm gonna get my stuff."
5174,"Chandler, will you just come in already?"
5175,"No, I prefer to keep a safe distance from all this merriment."
5176,"Look out, incoming pumpkin pie!"
5177,"Ok, we all laughed when you did it with the stuffing, but that's not funny anymore."
5178,"Hey, Monica, I got a question. I don't see any tater tots."
5179,That's not a question.
5180,"But my mom always makes them. It's like a tradition. You get a little piece of turkey on your fork, a little cranberry sauce, and a tot! It's bad enough I can't be with my family because of my disease."
5181,"All right, fine. Tonight's potatoes will be both mashed with lumps, and in the form of tots."
5182,"Ok, I'm off to talk to my unborn child."
5184,"Ok, Mom never hit."
5185,"Ok, all done."
5186,"What, Phoebe, did you whip the potatoes? Ross needs lumps!"
5187,"Oh, I'm sorry, oh, I just, I thought we could have them whipped and then add some peas and onions."
5188,Why would we do that?
5189,"Well, 'cause then they'd be like my mom used to make them, you know, before she d*ed."
5190,"Ok, three kinds of potatoes coming up."
5191,"Ok, good-bye you guys. Thanks for everything.  Oh, sorry! Oh, sorry!"
5192,The most unbelievable thing has happened. Underdog has just gotten away.
5193,The balloon?
5194,"No, no, the actual cartoon character. Of course the balloon. It's all over the news. Right before he reached Macy's, he broke free and was spotted flying over Washington Square Park. I'm goin' to the roof, who's with me?"
5195,"I can't, I gotta go."
5196,Come on. An 80-foot inflatable dog let loose over the city. How often does that happen?
5197,Almost never.
5198,Got the keys? or Got the keys!
5200,Anytime you're ready.
5201,"Ok, ok, here we go.  Ok, where am I talking to, here? I mean, uh, well, there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage, but..."
5202,Just aim for the bump.
5203,"Ok, ok, ok, ok, here goes. You know, I, you know, can't do this. Uh, this is too weird. I feel stupid."
5204,"So don't do it, it's fine. You don't have to do it just because Susan does it."
5205,"Hello, baby. Hello, hello."
5206,I loved the moment when you first saw the giant dog shadow all over the park.
5207,"Yeah, but did they have to sh**t him down? I mean, that was just mean."
5208,"Ok, right about now the turkey should be crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Why are we standing here?"
5209,We're waiting for you to open the door. You got the keys.
5210,No I don't.
5211,"Yes, you do. When we left, you said, ""got the keys."""
5212,"No I didn't. I asked, ""got the ke-eys?"""
5213,"No, no, no, you said, ""got the keys""."
5214,Do either of you have the keys?
5215,The oven is on.
5216,"Oh, I gotta get my ticket!"
5217,"Wait, wait, we have a copy of your key."
5218,"Well then get it, get it!"
5219,That tone will not make me go any faster.
5220,Joey!
5221,That one will.
5222,"And everyone's telling me, you gotta pick a major, you gotta pick a major. So, on a dare, I picked paleontology. And you have no idea what I'm saying, because, let's face it, you're a fetus. You're just happy you don't have gills anymore."
5223,"Look, you don't have to talk to it. You can sing to it if you want."
5224,"Oh, please. I am not singing to your stomach, ok?"
5225,"Hi, how's it goin?"
5226,"Shh!  Here we come, walkin' down the street, get the funniest looks from, everyone we meet. Hey, hey!  Hey, uh, did you just feel that?"
5228,"Does it always, uh--?"
5229,"No, no that was the first."
5230,Keep singing! Keep singing!
5231,"Hey, hey, you're my baby, and I can't wait to meet you. When you come out I'll buy you a bagel, and then we'll go to the zoo."
5232,I felt it!
5233,"Hey, hey, I'm your daddy. I'm the one without any breasts."
5234,"Nope, not that one."
5235,Can you go any faster with that?
5236,"Hey, I got one keyhole and about a zillion keys. You do the math."
5237,Why do you guys have so many keys in there anyway?
5238,For an emergency just like this.
5239,"All right, listen, smirky. If it wasn't for you and your stupid balloon, I would be on a plane watching a woman do this  right now. But I'm not."
5240,I swear you said you had the keys.
5241,"No, I didn't. I wouldn't say I had the keys unless I had the keys, and I obviously didn't have the keys."
5242,"Ooh, ok, that's it. Enough with the keys. No one say keys."
5243,Why would I have the keys?
5244,Aside from the fact that you said you had them?
5245,But I didn't.
5246,"Well, you should have."
5248,Because!
5251,"Why? Because everything is my responsibility? Isn't it enough that I'm making Thanksgiving dinner for everyone? You know, everyone wants a different kind of potatoes, so I'm making different kinds of potatoes. Does anybody care what kind of potatoes I want? Nooooo, no, no!  Just as long as Phoebe gets her peas and onions, and Mario gets his tots, and it's my first Thanksgiving, and it's all b*rned, and, and I... I..."
5252,"Ok, Monica, only dogs can hear you now, so, look, the door's open. Here we go."
5253,"Well, the turkey's burnt.  Potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined, potatoes are ruined."
5254,"Here we come, walkin' down the—this doesn't smell like Mom's."
5255,"No, it doesn't, does it? But you wanted lumps, Ross?  Well, here you go, buddy, ya got one."
5256,"Oh, god, this is great! The plane is gone, so it looks like I'm stuck here with you guys."
5257,"Hey, we all had better plans. This was nobody's first choice."
5258,"Oh, really? So why was I busting my ass to make this delicious Thanksgiving dinner?"
5259,You call that delicious?
5260,"Stop it, stop it, stop it!"
5261,Now this feels like Thanksgiving.
5262,Ooh.
5264,Ugly Naked Guy's taking his turkey out of the oven. Oh my god. He's not alone. Ugly Naked Guy's having Thanksgiving dinner with Ugly Naked Gal.
5265,I've gotta see this. All right Ugly Naked Guy!
5266,"Ooh, Ugly Naked Dancing!"
5267,It's nice that he has someone.
5268,Shall I carve?
5269,By all means.
5270,"Ok, who wants light cheese, and who wants dark cheese?"
5271,I don't even wanna know about the dark cheese.
5272,Does anybody wanna split this with me?
5273,"Oh, I will."
5274,"Ooh, you guys have to make a wish."
5275,Make a wish?
5276,"Come on, you know, Thanksgiving. Ooh, you got the bigger half. What'd you wish for?"
5277,The bigger half.
5278,"I'd like to propose a toast. Little toast here, ding ding. I know this isn't the kind of Thanksgiving that all of you all planned, but for me, this has been really great, you know, I think because it didn't involve divorce or projectile vomiting. Anyway, I was just thinking, I mean, if you'd gone to Vail, and if you guys'd been with your family, if you didn't have syphilis and stuff, we wouldn't be all together, you know? So I guess what I'm trying to say is that I'm very thankful that all of your Thanksgivings sucked."
5279,That's so sweet.
5280,"And hey, here's to a lousy Christmas."
5281,And a crappy New Year.
5282,"Here, here!"
5283,Alexa Junge
5284,guineapig
5285,Do you think they have yesterday's daily news?
5287,"Just wanna check my horoscope, see if it was right."
5288,"Oh my God.  Phoebe. Don't look now, but behind us is a guy who has the potential to break our hearts and plunge us into a pit of depression."
5289,"Where?  Ooh, come to Momma."
5290,"He's coming. Be cool, be cool, be cool."
5291,Nice hat.
5293,We should do something. Whistle.
5294,We are not going to whistle.
5295,"Come on, do it."
5297,Do it!
5299,Do it do it do it!
5300,Woo-woo!
5301,I can't believe you did that!
5302,"Why did I 'woo-hoo'? I mean, what was I hoping would happen? That-that he'd turn round and say 'I love that sound, I must have you now'?"
5303,"I just wish there was something we could do.  Hello. Hello, Coma Guy. GET UP, YOU GIRL SCOUT! UP! UP! UP!"
5304,"Phoebe, what are you doing?"
5305,Maybe nobody's tried this.
5306,"I wish we at least knew his name... Look at that face. I mean, even sleeping, he looks smart. I bet he's a lawyer."
5307,"Yeah, but did you see the dents in his knuckles? That means he's artistic."
5308,"Okay, he's a lawyer, who teaches sculpting on the side. And- he can dance!"
5309,"Oh! And, he's the kinda guy who, when you're talking, he's listening, y'know, and not saying 'Yeah, I understand' but really wondering what you look like naked."
5310,I wish all guys could be like him.
5312,Are there no conscious men in the city for you two?
5313,He doesn't have anyone.
5314,"Yeah, we-we feel kinda responsible."
5315,I can't believe you said woowoo. I don't even say woowoo.
5316,"Oh, she's coming up! She's coming up! "
5317,"Folks, when we come back we'll be talking about her new book, 'Euphoria Unbound': the always interesting Nora Tyler Bing. You might wanna put the kids to bed for this one."
5318,"Y'know, we don't have to watch this. Weekend At Bernie's is on Showtime, HBO, and Cinemax."
5319,"No way, forget it."
5320,"C'mon, she's your mom!"
5321,"Exactly. Weekend At Bernie's! Dead guy getting hit in the groin twenty, thirty times! No?"
5322,"Chandler, I gotta tell you, I love your mom's books! I love her books! I cannot get on a plane without one! I mean, this is so cool!"
5323,"Yeah, well, you wouldn't think it was cool if you're eleven years old and all your friends are passing around page 79 of 'Mistress Bitch.'"
5324,"C'mon, Chandler, I love your mom. I think she's a blast."
5325,You can say that because she's not your mom.
5326,"Oh, please..."
5327,Bona sera.
5328,"Oh, hi sweetie. "
5329,When did Rigatoni get back from Rome?
5330,Last night.
5331,"Ah, so then his plane didn't explode in a big ball of fire?... Just a dream I had- but, phew."
5332,Hey hey hey! She's on!
5333,Ah! Nora Bing!
5334,...Now what is this about you-you being arrested i-in London? What is that all about?
5335,Your mom was arrested?
5336,"Shhh, busy beaming with pride."
5337,"...This is kind of embarrassing, but occasionally after I've been intimate with a man..."
5338,Now why would she say that's embarrassing?
5339,Shhh.
5340,...I just get this craving for Kung Pow Chicken.
5341,THAT'S TOO MUCH INFORMATION!!
5342,"Alright, so now you're doing this whole book tour thing, how is that going?"
5343,"Oh, fine. I'm leaving for New York tomorrow, which I hate- but I get to see my son, who I love..."
5344,Awww!
5345,This is the way that I find out. Most moms use the phone.
5346,"Y'know, don't take this wrong, I-I just don't see you a-as a mom, somehow.. I don't mean that, I don't mean that bad..."
5347,"Oh no, I am a fabulous mom! I bought my son his first condoms."
5348,...And then he burst into flames.
5349,"Let's see. Congress is debating a new deficit reduction bill... the mayor wants to raise subway fares again... the high today was forty-five... and- oh, teams played sports."
5350,What about Glen? He could be a Glen.
5351,Nah... not-not special enough.
5352,Ooh! How about Agamemnon?
5353,Waaay too special.
5354,I am famished. What do I want... 
5355,Please God don't let it be Kung Pow Chicken.
5356,"Oh, you watched the show! What'd you think?"
5357,"Well, I think you need to come out of your shell just a little."
5358,What is this dive? Only you could've picked this place.
5359,"Oooh, c'mon, shut up, it's fun. Gimme a hug.  Well, I think we're ready for some tequila."
5360,I know I am.
5361,Who's doing sh*ts?
5364,There y'go. Ross?
5365,"Uh, I'm not really a sh*t drinking kinda guy."
5366,"Hi! Sorry- sorry we're late, we, uh, kinda just, y'know, lost track of time."
5367,...But a man can change. 
5368,Anyone want me to appraise anything?
5369,"Mrs. Bing, I have to tell you, I've read everything you've ever written. No, I mean it! I mean, when I read Euphoria at Midnight, all I wanted to do was become a writer."
5370,"Oh, please, honey, listen, if I can do it, anybody can. You just start with half a dozen European cities, throw in thirty euphemisms for male genitalia, and bam! You have got yourself a book."
5371,"Myyy mother, ladies and gentlemen."
5372,"Yeah, any messages for room 226?"
5373,"You okay there, slugger?"
5375,What is with you tonight?
5376,Nothing. Nothing nothing nothing.
5377,"Okay, thank you.  It's the Italian Hand-Licker, isn't it."
5378,No. It's the one he's licking.
5379,She's supposed to be with you.
5380,You're good.
5381,"Oh, Ross, listen to me. I have sold a hundred million copies of my books, and y'know why?"
5382,The girl on the cover with her nipples showing?
5383,"No. Because I know how to write men that women fall in love with. Believe me, I cannot sell a Paolo. People will not turn three hundred twenty-five pages for a Paolo. C'mon, the guy's a secondary character, a, y'know, complication you eventually k*ll off."
5384,When?
5385,He's not a hero. ...You know who our hero is.
5386,The guy on the cover with his nipples showing?
5387,"No, it's you!"
5389,"No, really, c'mon. You're smart, you're sexy..."
5391,"You are gonna be fine, believe me."
5393,Uhhhh.... I'll just pee in the street.
5394,"Hey, is Chandler here?"
5396,"Okay, uh, about last night, um, Chandler.. you didn't tell...  Okay, 'cause I'm thinking- we don't need to tell Chandler, I mean, it was just a kiss, right? One kiss? No big deal? Right?"
5397,Right. No big deal.
5399,In Bizarro World!! You broke the code!
5400,What code?
5401,"You don't kiss your friend's mom! Sisters are okay, maybe a hot-lookin' aunt... but not a mom, never a mom!"
5402,What are you guys doing out here?
5403,"Uh.. uh.. Well, Joey and I had discussed getting in an early morning racquetball game. But, um, apparently, somebody overslept."
5404,"Yeah, well, you don't have your racket."
5405,"No, no I don't, because it's being restrung, somebody was supposed to bring me one."
5406,"Yeah, well you didn't call and leave your grip size."
5407,"Okay, you guys spend waaaay too much time together. "
5408,"Okay, I'm scum, I'm scum."
5409,"Ross, how could you let this happen?"
5410,"I don't know, God, I... well, it's not like she's a regular mom, y'know? She's, she's sexy, she's..."
5411,You don't think my mom's sexy?
5412,Well... not in the same way...
5413,"I'll have you know that Gloria Tribbiani was a handsome woman in her day, alright? You think it's easy giving birth to seven children?"
5414,"Okay, I think we're getting into a weird area here..."
5417,What're you guys doing out here?
5418,"Well, not playing raquetball!"
5419,He forgot to leave his grip size!
5420,He didn't get the goggles!
5421,"Well,sounds like you two have issues."
5422,"Goodbye, baby."
5423,"Ciao, bela."
5424,Do they wait for me to do this?
5425,So are you gonna tell him?
5426,Why would I tell him?
5427,"How about 'cause if you don't, his mother might."
5428,Oh...
5430,Uhhhh.... he's not even wearing a jockstrap!
5431,...What did I ask?
5435,"Nothing, I just thought I'd stop by.. y'know, after the uh... that I.. y'know, so what are you doing here?"
5436,I'm not really here. Just thought I'd drop these off...on the way.. my way... Do you come here a lot? Without me?
5437,"No.  No! No! ...So, um, do you think he's doing any better than he was this morning?"
5438,How would I know? I-I wasn't here.
5439,"Really? Not even to, um, change his PAJAMAS?! "
5441,You're my friend. I-I had to tell you.
5442,I can't believe it. Paolo kissed my mom?
5443,"Yeah, um, I don't know if you noticed, but he had a lot to drink, and you know how he gets when he's drun..uh...  I can't do this, I did it, it was me, I'm sorry, I kissed your mom."
5445,"I was really upset about Rachel and Paolo, and I think I had too much tequila, and Nora- um, Mrs. Mom- your Bing- was just being nice, y'know, and- But nothing happened, nothing- Ask Joey, Joey, uh, came in-"
5446,You knew about this?
5447,"Uh... y'know, knowledge is a tricky thing."
5448,"I spent the entire day with you, why didn't you tell me?!"
5449,"Hey, hey, hey, you're lucky I caught them when I did, or else who knows what woulda happened."
5450,"Thanks, man, big help."
5451,I can't believe this! What the hell were you thinking?
5452,"I wasn't- I mean, I-"
5453,"Y'know, of all my friends, no-one knows the crap I go through with my mom more than you."
5454,I know-
5455,I can't believe you did this. 
5456,Chandler-
5457,"Me neither, y'know what-"
5458,I'm still mad at you for not telling me.
5459,What are you mad at me for?!
5461,You gotta let me slam the door! 
5462,"Chandler, I didn't kiss her, he did!  See what happens when you break the code?"
5463,Joey-
5464,Ah!  Huh? 
5467,"'A Woman Undone, by Rachel Karen Green'."
5468,"Yeah. Thought I'd give it a sh*t. I'm still on the first chapter. Now, do you think his 'love stick can be liberated from its denim prison'?"
5469,"Yeah, I'd say so. And there's no 'j' in 'engorged'."
5470,Hey Rach.
5472,Hello.
5474,Going to the hospital tonight?
5475,"No, you?"
5477,You just asked me.
5478,"Okay, maybe it was a trick question.  Um, Rachel can we do this now?"
5479,Okay.  I am so hot!
5480,"Now, here's a picture of my mother and father on their wedding day. Now you tell me she's not a knockout."
5481,I cannot believe we're having this conversation.
5482,"C'mon! Just try to picture her not pregnant, that's all."
5483,Central Perk is proud to present Miss Phoebe Buffay.
5484,"Thanks. Hi, um, 'kay. I'd like to start with a song that's about a man that I recently met, who's, um, come to be very important to me.  'Kay. "
5485,"Okay, that was Phoebe Buffay, everybody. Woo!"
5486,What was that?
5487,"Oh, uh, Phoebe just started a..."
5488,"Yeah, I believe I was talking to Joey, alright there, Mother-Kisser? "
5489,Mother-Kisser...  I'll shut up.
5490,"Chandler, can I just say something? I-I know you're still mad at me, I just wanna say that there were two people there that night. Okay? Two sets of lips."
5491,"Yes, well, I expect this from her. Okay? She's always been a Freudian nightmare."
5492,"Okay, well, if she always behaves like this, why don't you say something?"
5493,"Because it's complicated, it's complex- Hey, you kissed my mom!"
5494,We're rehearsing a Greek play.
5495,That's very funny. We done now?
5496,"No! Okay, you mean, you're not gonna talk to her, you're not gonna tell her how you feel?"
5497,"That would be no. Look, just because you played tonsil tennis with my mom doesn't mean you know her. Alright? Trust me, you can't talk to her."
5498,"Okay, 'you' can't, or  you can't?  Okay, that's my finger.  That's, that's my knee.  Still doing the play. Aaah!"
5499,"Alright, whadyou do with him?"
5500,Oh! You're awake!
5501,"Look at you! How, how do you feel?"
5502,"Uh, a little woozy, but basically okay."
5503,You look good!
5504,I feel good! ...Who are you?
5505,"Oh, sorry."
5506,I'm Phoebe Buffay.
5507,I'm Monica Geller. I've been taking care of you.
5508,"Well, we both have."
5509,"So, the Etch-a-Sketch is from you guys?"
5510,"Well, actually it's just from me."
5511,I got you the foot massager.
5512,You know who shaved you? That was me.
5513,I read to you.
5514,I sang.  Hah!
5515,"Well,... thanks."
5516,"Oh, my pleasure."
5518,So. I guess I'll see you around.
5519,"What, that's it?"
5520,"""See you around?"""
5521,"Well, what do you want me to say?"
5522,"Oh, I don't know. Maybe, um, ""That was nice?"" Admit something to me? ""I'll call you?"""
5523,"Alright, I'll call you."
5524,I don't think you mean that.
5525,"This is so typical. Y'know, we give, and we give, and we give. And then- we just get nothing back! And then one day, y'know, it's just, you wake up, and ""See you around!"" Let's go, Phoebe."
5526,Y'know what? We thought you were different. But I guess it was just the coma.
5527,"Car's waiting downstairs, I just wanted to drop off these copies of my book for your friends. Anything you want from Lisbon?"
5528,"No, just knowing you're gonna be there is enough."
5529,"Alright, well, be good, I love you. "
5530,You kissed my best Ross! ...Or something to that effect.
5531,"O-kay. Look, it, it was stupid."
5532,Really stupid.
5533,"Really stupid. And I don't even know how it happened. I'm sorry, honey, I promise it will never happen again. Are we okay now?"
5534,Yeah. No. No...
5535,"Ah, the forbidden love of a man and his door."
5536,"Shh. He did it. He told her off, and not just about the kiss, about everything."
5538,"No, no. He said ""When are you gonna grow up and start being a mom?"""
5540,"Then she came back with ""The question is, when are you gonna grow up and realise I have a b*mb?"""
5541,"'Kay, wait a minute, are you sure she didn't say ""When are you gonna grow up and realise I am your mom?"""
5542,That makes more sense.
5543,"So, what's going on now?"
5544,"I dunno, I've been standing here spelling it out for you!  I don't hear anything. Oh, wait, wait, wait. "
5545,Whaddya see?
5546,"Hard to tell, they're so tiny and upside-down. Wait, wait. They're walking away... they're walking away... No, no they're not, they're coming right at us! Run! Run!"
5547,"You okay, kiddo?"
5548,"Yeah, okay."
5549,Alright. 
5550,Nice save.
5551,Mrs. Bing.
5552,Mr. Geller.
5554,You mean that?
5555,"Yeah, why not.  So I told her."
5556,Yeah? How'd it go?
5557,Awful. Awful. Couldn'ta gone worse.
5558,"Well, howdya feel?"
5559,Pretty good! I told her.
5560,"Well, see? So, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea, y'know, me kissing your mom, uh? Huh?  But.. we don't have to go down that road."
5561,"Okay. Now this is just the first chapter, and I want your absolute honest opinion. Oh, oh, and on page two, he's not 'reaching for her heaving beasts'."
5562,What's a 'niffle'?
5563,You usually find them on the 'heaving beasts'.
5564,"Alright, alright, so I'm not a great typist..."
5565,"Wait, did you get to the part about his 'huge throbbing pens'? Tell ya, you don't wanna be around when he starts writing with those!"
5566,"Alright, that's it! Give it back! That's it!"
5568,"Jeffrey Astrof, Mike Sikowitz, Adam Chase &amp; Ira Ungerleider"
5569,Jim &amp; Tracy Lambers
5571,"No-no-no-no, we're done."
5572,"Aunt Syl, stop yelling! All I'm saying is that if you had told me vegetarian lasagna, I would have made vegetarian lasagna.  Well, the meat's only every third layer, maybe you could scrape."
5573,"Ross, did you really read all these baby books?"
5574,"Yup! You could plunk me down in the middle of any woman's uterus, no compass, and I can find my way out of there like that! "
5575,"Ooh, this is cool...it says in some parts of the world, people actually eat the placenta. "
5576,"And, we're done with the yogurt. "
5577,Sorry. 
5578,"Aunt Syl, I did this as a favor, I am not a caterer. What do you want me to do with a dozen lasagnas?  Nice talk, Aunt Syl.  You kiss Uncle Freddie with that mouth?"
5579,"Hey Ross, listen, you know that right now, your baby's only this big?  This is your baby.  Hi Daddy!"
5580,Hello!
5581,How come you don't live with Mommy?  How come Mommy lives with that other lady?  What's a lesbian? 
5582,"Honey, you can say it, Poconos, Poconos, it's like Poc-o-nos "
5583,"Ah, poke  a  nose, mmm "
5584,"Mma, Mma, Mmaah"
5585,"So, did I hear Poconos?"
5586,"Yes, my sister's giving us her place for the weekend."
5587,"Woo-hoo, first weekend away together!"
5588,"Yeah, that's a big step."
5589,I know...
5590,"Ah, it's just a weekend, big deal!"
5591,"Wasn't this supposed to be just a fling, huh? Shouldn't it be... flung by now?"
5592,"I mean, we are way past the fling thing, I mean, I am feeling things that I've only read about in Danielle Steele books, you know? I mean, when I'm with him, I'm totally, totally..."
5593,"...nauseous, I'm physically nauseous. What am I supposed to do, huh? Call immigration?  I could call immigration!"
5594,"I love babies, with their little baby shoes, and their little baby toes, and their little baby hands..."
5595,"Ok, you're going to have to stop that, forever!"
5596,Need a new table.
5597,You think?
5598,"Hey hey, come on in!"
5599,"Hey, hello! mmwa!  I brought all the books, and Monica sends her love, along with this lasagna."
5600,"Oh great! Is it vegetarian, 'cause Susan doesn't eat meat."
5601,I'm pretty sure that it is...
5602,"So, I got the results of the amnio today."
5603,"Oh, tell me, tell me, is everything, uhh....?"
5604,Totally and completely healthy!
5605,"Oh, that's great, that is great! "
5606,"Hey, when did you and Susan meet Huey Lewis?"
5607,"Uh, that's our friend Tanya."
5608,Of course it's your friend Tanya. 
5609,Don't you want to know about the sex?
5610,"The sex?  Um, I'm having enough trouble with the image of you and Susan together, when you throw in Tanya , yaw..."
5611,"The sex of the baby, Ross."
5612,"Oh, you know the sex of the baby? Oh, oh-oh-oh!"
5613,Do you want to know?
5614,"No, no, no, no, no, I don't want to know, absolutely not. I think, you know, I think you should know until you look down there, and say, oop, there it is!  Or isn't..."
5615,"Oh, hello Ross!"
5616,Susan...
5617,"So, so, did you hear?"
5618,"Yes, we did, everything's A-OK!"
5619,"Oh, that's so...  It really is...do we know...?"
5620,"Yes, we certainly do, it's going to be..."
5621,"Oh, hey hey hey, ho ho ho, hello, guy who doesn't want to know, standing right here!"
5622,"Oh, well, is it what we thought it would be?"
5623,Mm-hmmm 
5624,"Ok, what, what...ok, what did we think it was going to be?"
5625,It's a...
5626,"No, no, no I don't want to know, don't want to know. Ok, you know, I should probably, I should probably just go."
5627,"Well, thanks for the books."
5628,"No problem, ok, mmmwa  oh, mmmwa  Susan... "
5629,"All right, who should we call first, your folks, or Deb and Rona? "
5631,"Uh, never mind, I don't want to know. "
5632,"Ok, so it's just because it was my table, I have to buy a new one?"
5633,That's the rule.
5634,"What rule? There's no rule, if anything, you owe me a table!"
5635,How'd you get to that?
5636,"Well, I believe the piece of furniture was fine until your little breakfast adventure with Angela Delvecchio"
5637,You knew about that?
5638,"Well, let's just say the impressions you made in the butter left little to the imagination."
5639,"Ok, ok, How about if we split it?"
5640,"What do you mean, like, buy it together?"
5641,Yeah
5642,You think we're ready for something like that?
5644,"Well, it's a pretty big commitment, I mean, what if one of us wants to move out?"
5645,"Why, are you moving out?"
5646,I'm not moving out.
5647,You'd tell me if you were moving out right
5648,"Yeah, yeah, it's just that with my last roommate Kip..."
5649,"Aw, I know all about Kip!"
5650,"It's just that we bought a hibachi together, and then he ran off and got married, and things got pretty ugly."
5651,"Well, let me ask you something, was Kip a better roommate than me?"
5652,"Aw, don't do that"
5653,We've got a couple changes in your schedule. Your 4:00 herbal massage has been pushed back to 4:30 and Miss Somerfield canceled her 5:30 shiatsu.
5654,"Ok, thanks. "
5655,"Oh, here comes your 3:00. I don't mean to sound unprofessional, but, yum "
5656,"Buon Giorno, Bella Phoebe!"
5657,"Oh, Paolo, hi, what are you doing here?"
5658,"Uh, Racquela tell me you massage, eh?"
5659,"Well, Racquela's right, yeah!"
5660,"Oh, okay, I don't know what you just said, so let's get started."
5661,"Uh, I am, uh, being naked?"
5662,"Um, that's really your decision, I mean, some people prefer, you know, to take off...oh whoops! You're being naked!"
5663,"I can't believe you don't want to know. I mean, I couldn't not know, I mean, if, if the doctor knows, and Carol knows, and Susan knows...."
5664,And Monica knows...
5665,"Wha, heh, how could you know, I don't even know!"
5666,"Carol called me to thank me for the lasagna, I asked, she told me."
5667,So what's it gonna be? 
5668,"Wait—oh—hey—huh, oh great now he knows, and I don't know!"
5669,"I'm sorry, I'm just excited about being an aunt!"
5670,Or an uncle...
5671,Hey Phoebe!
5672,Hi Pheebs!
5673,Pheebs!
5674,Fine!
5675,"Phoebe, what's the matter?"
5676,"Nothing, I'm sorry, I'm just, I'm out of sorts."
5677,"Hey, can we get some cappuccino over here?"
5678,"Oh, right, that's me!"
5679,"Hey, Chandler, that table place closes at 7, come on."
5680,Fine. 
5681,"Phoebe, what is it?"
5682,"All right, you know Paolo?"
5683,"I'm familiar with his work, yes..."
5684,"Well, he made a move on me."
5685,"Whoa, store will be open tomorrow!"
5686,"More coffee over here, please!"
5687,"Well, what happened?"
5688,"Well, he came in for a massage, and everything was fine until. "
5689,Ooooohh!
5690,My God.
5692,"Oh yeah, I'm sure.  And all of a sudden his hands weren't the problem anymore. "
5693,Was it...?
5694,"Oh, boy scouts could have camped under there."
5695,Oooooo....
5696,"""Ooo,"" what?"
5697,Uma Thurman.
5699,The actress!
5700,Thanks Rach.
5702,"You have to tell her! You have to tell her! It's your moral obligation, as a friend, as a woman, I think it's a feminist issue! Guys? Guys? "
5703,"Oh, yeah, you have to tell her."
5704,Feminist issue. That's where I went!
5705,She is gonna hate me.
5706,"Will you pick one, just pick one! Here, how about that one? "
5707,That's patio furniture!
5708,"So what, like people are gonna come in and think, ""Uh-oh, I'm outside again?"" Of course!"
5709,What about the birds?
5710,"I don't know, birds just don't say, ""Hello, sit here, eat something."""
5711,You pick one.
5712,"All right, how about the ladybugs?"
5713,"Oh, so, forget about the birds, but big red insects suggest fine dining!"
5714,"Fine, you want to get the birds, get the birds!"
5715,"Not like that, I won't!  Kip would have liked the birds! "
5718,Are you moving out?
5719,"No, these aren't all my suitcases.  This one's Paolo's."
5720,"Um, um, Rachel can we talk for a sec?"
5721,"Well, sure...just a sec, though, 'cause Paolo's on his way over."
5722,"Oh!  Ok, um, ok, um,"
5723,"Oh, Pheebs, Pheebs..."
5724,"Ok, um,  we haven't known each other for that long a time, and, um, there are three things that you should know about me. One, my friends are the most important thing in my life, two, I never lie, and three, I make the best oatmeal raisin cookies in the world. "
5725,"Ok, thanks Pheebs  Oh my God, why have I never tasted these before?!"
5726,"Oh, I don't make them a lot because I don't think it's fair to the other cookies"
5727,"All right, well, you're right, these are the best oatmeal cookies I've ever had."
5728,Which proves that I never lie.
5729,I guess you don't.
5730,Paolo made a pass at me.
5731,"So, what do you think?"
5732,I think It's the most beautiful table I've ever seen.
5733,I know!
5734,"So how does this work, you going to balance the plates on these little guys' heads?"
5735,"Who cares, we'll eat at the sink! Come on, let's play!"
5736,Heads up Ross!  Score!  You suck!
5737,Are you okay?
5738,I need some milk.
5739,"Ok, I've got milk  Here you go...  Oh! Better?"
5740,"No...oh, I feel so stupid! Oh, I think about the other day with you guys and I was all ""Oh, Paolo, he's so great, he makes me feel so..."" Oh, God, I'm so embarrassed!"
5741,"I'm so embarrassed, I'm the one he hit on!"
5742,"Pheebs, if I had never met him this never would have happened!"
5743,I'm so sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry! No I'm sorry!
5744,"No, wait, oh, what are we sorry about?"
5745,"I don't know...right, he's the pig!"
5746,Such a pig!
5747,"Oh, God, he's such a pig,"
5748,Oh he's like a...
5749,He's like a big disgusting...
5750,...like a...
5751,...pig...pig man!
5752,"Yes, good! Ok..."
5753,"Oh, but he was my pig man...how did I not see this?"
5754,"Oh! I know!  It's because... he's gorgeous, and he's charming, and when he looks at you..."
5755,"Ok, Ok, Pheebs..."
5756,The end.
5757,"Oh, God..."
5758,Should I not have told you?
5759,"No, no, trust, me, it's, it's, it's much better that I know. Uh, I just liked it better before it was better..."
5760,"I think she took it pretty well. You know Paolo's over there right now, so..."
5761,We should get over there and see if she's okay.  Just one...second! Score!  Game! Come on. 
5762,"Ah...ooh! Well, looks like, uh, we kicked your butts."
5763,"No-no, she kicked our butts. You could be on the Olympic standing-there team."
5764,"Come on, two on one."
5765,"What are you still doing here? She just broke up with the guy, it's time for you to swoop in!"
5766,"What, now?"
5767,"Yes, now is when you swoop! You gotta make sure that when Paolo walks out of there, the first guy Rachel sees is you, She's gotta know that you're everything he's not! You're like, like the anti-Paolo!"
5768,"My Catholic friend is right. She's distraught. You're there for her. You pick up the pieces, and then you usher in the age of Ross! "
5769,"No, that's cold, that's cold, that's..."
5771,"Don't stare. Now she just finished throwing his clothes off the balcony, now there's just a lot of gesturing and arm-waving, , Ok, that is either, ""How could you?"" or, ""Enormous breasts!"" Here he comes!"
5772,Ooh!
5773,"Uh, I am, uh, to say good-bye."
5774,"Oh, ok bye-bye."
5775,"Paolo, I really hate you for what you did to Rachel,  but I still have five of these, so heat it at 375 until the cheese bubbles."
5776,Grazie.
5777,"Paolo, I-I just want to tell you and I think I speak for everyone when I say... "
5778,"Oh, just look at her... "
5779,"Oh you guys, I-I really think just one of us should go out there so she's not overwhelmed..."
5780,"Oh, you're right."
5781,...and I really think it should be me.
5784,You all right?
5785,"Ooh, I've been better..."
5786,"Come here.  Listen, you deserve so much better than him...you know, I mean, you, you, you should be with a guy who knows what he has when he has you."
5787,"Oh, Ross..."
5789,"I am so sick of guys. I don't want to look at another guy, I don't want to think about another guy, I don't even want to be near another guy. "
5791,"Oh Ross, you're so great!"
5792,Ohhhh 
5793,"Ooh...hey honey, are you all right?"
5796,...medium...hmm...any cookies left?
5797,Yep!
5798,"See, Rach, uh, see, I don't think that swearing off guys altogether is the answer. I really don't. I think that what you need is to develop a more sophisticated screening process."
5799,"No. I just need to be by myself for a while, you know? I just got to figure out what I want"
5800,"Uh, no, no, see, because not...not all guys are going to be a Paolo."
5801,"No, I know, I know, and I'm sure your little boy is not going to grow up to be one."
5804,"I-I'm, I'm having a boy?"
5805,"Uh...no. No, no, in fact, you're not having a boy."
5806,"Wha-I'm having, I'm having a boy!  Huh, am I having a boy?"
5807,"Yes, you're having a boy! "
5808,"I'm having a boy! Oh, I'm having a boy!"
5809,Wha-
5812,I'm having a boy! I-I'm having a boy!
5815,We already knew that! 
5816,I'm having a son. Um...
5817,Yes! And that would be a shut-down!
5818,Shut-out!! 
5819,"Where are you guys going? Come on, one more game!"
5820,"Uh, it's 2:30 in the morning!"
5821,"Yeah, get out!"
5822,"You guys are always hanging out in my apartment! Come on, I'll only use my left hand, huh? Come on, wussies!  All right, ok, I gotta go. I'm going,  and I'm gone."
5823,One more game?
5824,Oh yeah!
5825,"Ok, so this is pretty much what's happened so far. Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like ""forget about her"" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, ""Oh my god."" So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?"
5826,Oh my god. Oh my god. Excuse me. Emergency! Excuse me!
5827,Rache!
5828,"Oh, there you are! Hi! Oh, so, so, how was China, you?"
5829,"It was, it was great. Oh, what happened?"
5831,You're bleeding.
5832,"I am? Oh, look at that, yes I am. Enough about me, enough about me, Mr. Back from the Orient. I wanna hear everything!"
5833,"Well, where do I start? This is Julie. Julie, this is Rachel."
5834,"These are, these aren't for you. These are for you. Welcome to our country."
5835,Thank you. I'm from New York.
5836,"Ok, well, not a problem. We'll just use them to stop the bleeding. Ok. Baggage claim? Ok."
5837,"I'm telling you, she went to the airport, and she's gonna go for it with Ross."
5838,"Oh my god. This is huge. This is bigger than huge. This is like, all right, what's bigger than huge?"
5839,"Um, this?"
5841,"Guys, you got your hair cut."
5842,"Yes, yes, we did, thanks to Vidal Buffay."
5843,"'Cause, you know, if you don't look good, we don't look good. I love that voice."
5844,"Airport, airport. Ross, not alone, Julie, arm around her. Cramp, cramp."
5845,"Ok, I think she's trying to tell us something. Quick, get the verbs."
5846,"You, you, you said he liked me. You, you slowpokes!"
5847,"That's all right, Rache, we got the bags. Hi, hello. Julie, this is my sister Monica, Chandler, Joey. Everyone, this is Julie."
5848,"Hi, but I'm not here, you haven't met me. I'll make a much better first impression tomorrow when I don't have 20 hours of cab and plane on me."
5849,And bus.
5851,You gotta hear this story.
5852,"We're on this bus, that's easily 200 years old, and this guy--"
5853,"And the chicken poops in her lap. Oh, I'm so sorry. I just gave away the ending, didn't I? Oh! It's just, I just heard this story in the cab, and it is all I can think about."
5854,"This is amazing. I mean, how, how did this happen?"
5855,"Well, Ross and I were in grad school together."
5856,"But we haven't seen each other since then. Well I land in China, guess who's in charge of the dig."
5857,"Julie! Julie, isn't that great? I mean, isn't that just kick- you-in-the-crotch, spit-on-your-neck fantastic?"
5858,It's just an expression.
5859,"Well, we just wanted to say a quick hi, and then we're gonna go see the baby."
5860,And then we've gotta get some sleep.
5861,"Yeah, it's really 6:00 tomorrow night our time."
5862,"Well, listen, don't tell us what's gonna happen, 'cause I like to be surprised."
5863,"Hey, Rache, can I get some coffee?"
5864,"Yeah, sure."
5866,"Hey, Rache, can I get--"
5867,Did you talk to him?
5868,Not yet.
5869,"Then, no."
5870,"So what the hell happened to you in China? I mean, when last we left you, you were totally in love with, you know."
5871,"I know, I know I was, but there was always this little voice inside that kept saying it's never gonna happen, move on. You know whose voice that was?"
5872,God?
5873,"It was you, pal."
5874,"Well, maybe it was God, doing me."
5875,"Look, you were right. She looks at me and sees a friend, that's all. But then I met Julie, and I don't know, we're havin' a great time. And I never would've gone for it with her if it hadn't been for you."
5876,"Well, you owe me one, big guy."
5877,Here's your lemonade.
5878,I didn't order lemonade.
5879,"Oh. Well than, you better go take that back because they're gonna charge you for that."
5881,"Go go go go, come on! Well, what did you find out?"
5882,"He said, he said that they're having a great time. I'm sorry. But, the silver lining, if you wanna see it, is that he made the decision all by himself without any outside help whatsoever."
5883,How is that the silver lining?
5884,You have to really wanna see it.
5885,"Ironically, these are the guys who were picked last in gym."
5886,"Phoebes, you know what I'm thinking?"
5887,"Oh, ok. How, it's been so long since you've had sex, you're wondering if they've changed it?"
5888,"No, although now that's what I'm thinking."
5889,"All right, so what were you thinking?"
5890,"Well, I was thinking, that you gave the guys such great haircuts, I thought, maybe you'd like to do mine?"
5891,Oh. No.
5893,"Because, I'm just, I'm incredibly a**l and an unbelievable control freak."
5894,No you're not.
5895,"I know I'm not, but you are, and I was trying to spare your feelings."
5896,"Hello? Oh, hi. Yeah, hold on a second. Ross, it's Julie."
5897,Hello? Hi.
5898,Hi. Anybody know a good tailor?
5899,Needs some clothes altered?
5900,"No, no, I'm just looking for a man to draw on me with chalk."
5901,"Why don't you go see Frankie? My family's been goin' to him forever. He did my first suit when I was 15. No wait, 16. No, 'scuse me, 15. All right, when was 1990?"
5902,You have to stop the Q-tip when there's resistance!
5903,"Ok, ok, sweetheart, I'll see you later. Ok, bye. What? Oh, that is so sweet. No, no, ok, you hang up. Ok, ok, one, two, three. Well you didn't hang up either. Ok, no, no, you hang up. You, you, y--"
5904,"Sorry, I thought you were talking to me."
5905,Rachel! I'll just call her back.
5906,"Ok, ok, ok. How did this happen to me? How did this happen to me? A week ago, two weeks ago, I was fine. Ross was just Ross, just this guy. Now he's Rrrooossss, oh, this really great guy that I can't have."
5907,"Sweetie, I wanted you to have him too."
5908,"I know you did. I'm just gonna deal with it, I'm just gonna deal with it. I gotta get out of here."
5909,"Ok, I don't care what you guys say, something's bothering her."
5910,"You know, I think I was sixteen."
5911,"Please, just a little bit off the back."
5912,"I'm still on ""no""."
5913,"Uh, morning. Do you guys think you could close your eyes for just a sec?"
5914,"No no no no no, I'm not fallin' for that again."
5916,"Well, I sorta did a stupid thing last night."
5917,What stupid thing did you do?
5918,Bon giorno tutti!
5920,"Ok, Paulo, why don't you just go get dressed, and then you be on your way, ok, bye-bye."
5921,"Rachel, how did this happen?"
5922,"I don't know, I just kinda ran into him last night."
5924,At his apartment. Is this juice?
5925,"Whoa, whoa. And the fact that you dumped him because he hit on Phoebe?"
5926,"I know, I know I'm a pathetic loser."
5927,"Honey, you're not pathetic, you're sad."
5928,People do stupid things when they're upset.
5929,"My god, if I had a nickel for every guy I wish I hadn't--but this is about your horrible mistake."
5930,"Hi. Sorry we're late but we were--well, there was touching."
5931,"Hey, hey Ross."
5932,"Hey, Paulo. What are you doing here?"
5933,I do Raquel.
5934,"So, uh, he's back."
5935,"Yeah, he's back. Is that a problem?"
5936,"No, not a problem."
5937,I'm glad it's not a problem.
5938,"Ok, you're gonna have to not touch my ass."
5939,"Well, in spite of the yummy bagels and palpable tension, I've got pants that need to be altered."
5940,"Hey, Chandler, when you see Frankie, tell him Joey says hello. He'll know what it means."
5941,Are you sure he's gonna be able to cr*ck that code?
5942,"You know it's funny, the last time Paulo was here, my hair was so much shorter and cuter."
5943,"All right. Ok, but, but you have to promise that you will not be all like control-y and bossy and Monica about it."
5944,I promise.
5945,"All right. Now some of you are gonna get cut, and some of you aren't. But I promise none of you are gonna feel a thing."
5946,"All right, that's it, I quit."
5947,What? I didn't say anything.
5948,"Yeah, but this isn't the face of a person who trusts a person. Ok, this is the face of a person who, you know, doesn't trust a person."
5949,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Phoebe. It's just a little shorter than what we had discussed."
5950,Would you relax? I know what I am doing. This is how he wears it.
5951,How who wears it?
5952,Demi Moore.
5953,Demi Moore is not a he.
5954,"Well, he was a he in Arthur, and in Ten."
5955,That's Dudley Moore. I said I wanted it like Demi Moore.
5956,"Oh, oh, oh my god!"
5957,Oh my god!
5958,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Which one's Demi Moore?"
5959,"She's the actress who was in Disclosure, Indecent Proposal, Ghost."
5960,"Oh, she's got gorgeous hair."
5961,I KNOW!
5962,How long do you want the cuffs?
5963,At least as long as I have the pants.
5964,"I just got that. Ok, now we'll do your inseam."
5965,How is she?
5966,"It's too soon to tell. She's resting, which is a good sign."
5967,How's the hair?
5968,"I'm not gonna lie to you, Ross, it doesn't look good. I put a clip on one side, which seems to have stopped the curling."
5969,Can we see her?
5970,"Your hair looks too good, I think it would upset her. Ross, you come on in."
5971,How're you doing?
5972,I'm ok.
5973,"Ooh, that bad, huh? Look, I can sense when women are depressed and vulnerable. It's one of my gifts."
5974,"When I saw him get off that plane with her, I really thought I hit rock bottom. But today, it's like there's rock bottom, then 50 feet of crap, then me."
5975,You gotta tell Ross how you feel.
5976,Come on. How can I just tell him? What about Julie?
5977,What about her? They've only been going out for two weeks. Ross has been in love with you for like 10 years.
5978,"I don't know, I don't know."
5979,"Look, Rache, Rache, I've been with my share of women. In fact, I've been with like a lot of people's share of women. The point is, I've never felt about anyone the way Ross felt about you."
5980,"Yo, paisan. Can I talk to you for a sec? Your tailor is a very bad man."
5981,Frankie? What're you talking about?
5982,"Hey, what's goin' on?"
5983,Joey's tailor...took advantage of me.
5985,No way. I've been going to the guy for 12 years.
5986,"He said he was going to do my inseam, and he ran his hand up my leg, and then, there was definite--"
5987,what?
5988,Cupping.
5989,"That's how they do pants. First they go up one side, they move it over, they go up the other side, they move it back, and then they do the rear. What? Ross, Ross, would you tell him? Isn't that how they measure pants?"
5990,"Yes, yes it is. In prison! Whatsa matter with you?"
5991,What? That's not? Oh my god.
5992,Even Mary Tyler Moore would've been better.
5993,"I like it. I do, I think it's a Ten."
5994,Thank you. My hair is very amused.
5995,"Come on, Monica, things could be worse. You could get caught between the moon and New York City. I know it's crazy, but it's true."
5997,"Well, I gotta go. Bye. Bye, Rache."
5998,"Wait, are you leaving?"
5999,"Yeah, that's kinda what I meant by ""bye!"""
6000,"Hey, when the doctor does that hernia test..."
6001,That's ok.
6003,"Well, first of all, Paulo and I are not back together. It was just a stupid thing I did, and if I could go back in time and do it again, well, I wouldn't. Um, second of all, what?"
6004,"Ok. Well, before I say anything, I just need to know, is this one of those things where you break up with a guy, and then I tell you what I think, and then the next day you get back together with the guy, and I look like a complete idiot?"
6006,"Well, then, I think, I think the guy is scum. I hate him. I physically hate him. I always have. You are way too good to be with a guy like that. You deserve to be with someone who appreciates you, and who gets how funny and sweet and amazing, and adorable, and sexy you are, you know? Someone who wakes up every morning thinking ""Oh my god, I'm with Rachel"". You know, someone who makes you feel good, the way I am with Julie. Was there a second of all?"
6007,"No, I think that was the whole all."
6008,"I swear to god, Dad. That's not how they measure pants."
6009,"I was thinking of doing it a little shorter, you know, like Andy McDowell's new haircut?"
6010,You wanna do it right now?
6011,Great!
6012,"Ok, I just wanna be really sure this time. Andy McDowell's the girl from Four Weddings and a Funeral, right?"
6013,No. No no no no no. That's Rodney McDowell. Andy McDowell is the guy from Planet of the Apes.
6014,"Oh, yeah. Ok, thank you."
6016,"Ok, these were unbelievably expensive, and I know he's gonna grow out of them in like, 20 minutes, but I couldn't resist."
6017,"Oh, look at these! Hey, Ben. Just do it. Oh my god, oh, ok, was that too much pressure for him?"
6018,"You know, it's...something funny about sneakers. I'll be right back."
6019,"I gotta get one, too."
6020,What are you guys doing?
6021,We're just hanging out by the spoons. Ladle?
6022,"Look, would you guys grow up? That is the most natural beautiful thing in the world."
6023,"Yeah, we know, but there's a baby suckin' on it."
6024,"This is my son having lunch, ok? It's gonna happen a lot, so you'd better get used to it. Now if you have any problem with it, if you're uncomfortable, just ask questions. Carol's fine with it, now come on."
6025,"Carol, Carol? I was just wondering if Joey could ask you a question about breast-feeding?"
6027,"Uh, does it hurt?"
6028,"It did at first, but not anymore."
6030,"So, uh, how often can you do it?"
6031,As much as he needs.
6032,"Ok, I got one, I got one. If he blows into one, does the other one get bigger?"
6033,"Rachel, do you have any muffins left?"
6034,"Yeah, I forget which ones."
6035,"Oh, you're busy, that's ok, I'll get it. Anybody else want one? Oh, you're losin' your apron here, let me get it. There you go."
6036,Thank you. What a bitch.
6037,"Oh, listen you guys. I have this friend at Bloomingdales who's quitting tomorrow and he wants to abuse his discount. So, anyone want to come with me and take advantage of it?"
6038,"I can't, I have to take my grandmother to the vet."
6039,"Ok, um, I'll go with you."
6041,"Hi, honey."
6042,"Hey, sweetums."
6043,Hello to the rest.
6044,Monica what're you doin'? You can't go shopping with her? What about Rachel?
6045,"It's gonna be a problem, isn't it?"
6046,"Come on, you're going to Bloomingdales with Julie? That's like cheating on Rachel in her house of worship."
6047,But I'm--
6048,"Monica, she will k*ll you. She will k*ll you like a dog in the street."
6049,"So, uh, Jules tells me you guys are going shopping tomorrow?"
6050,"Yeah, uh, it's actually not that big a deal."
6051,"It's a big deal to me. This is great, Monica. I really appreciate this."
6053,"Woof, woof."
6054,Bijan for men? Hey Annabelle.
6055,"Hey, Joey. So did you hear about the new guy?"
6057,Nobody knows his name. Me and the girls just call him the Hombre man.
6058,What's he doin' in my section?
6059,I guess he doesn't know.
6060,"Well, he's gonna. I'll see you a little later, ok? Hey, how ya doin'?"
6061,Mornin'.
6062,"Listen, I know you're new, but it's kinda understood that everything from Young Men's to the escalator is my territory."
6063,"Your territory, huh?"
6064,Yeah. Bijan for men?
6065,No thanks.
6066,Hombre?
6067,Yeah. All right.
6068,You were saying?
6069,"Phoebe, listen. You were with me, and we were shopping all day."
6071,"We were shopping, and we had lunch."
6072,"Oh, all right. What did I have?"
6073,You had a salad.
6074,"Oh, no wonder I don't feel full."
6075,"Hey, guys, what's up."
6076,"I went shopping with Monica all day, and I had a salad."
6077,"Good, Pheebs. What'd you buy?"
6078,"Um, we went shopping for um, for, fur."
6079,You went shopping for fur?
6080,"Yes, and then I realized I'm against that, and uh, so then we bought some, uh, boobs."
6081,You bought boobs?
6082,Bras! We bought bras! We bought bras.
6083,"Bijan for men? Hey, Annabelle, Uh, listen, I was wondering if maybe after work we could go maybe grab a cup of coffee."
6084,"Oh, actually I sorta have plans."
6085,"Ready, Annabelle?"
6086,You bet. Maybe some other time?
6087,"Hey, it's not the first time I lost a girl to a cowboy spraying cologne. Bijan for men?"
6088,"Ok, and this is Funny Clown. Funny Clown is only for after his naps, not before his naps or he won't sleep."
6089,"Carol, we've been through this before, ok? We have a good time. We laugh, we play. It's like we're father and son."
6090,"Honey, relax. Ross is great with him. Don't look so surprised. I'm a lovely person."
6091,"Oh, this is so cute."
6092,"Oh, I got that for him."
6093,My mommies love me. That's clever.
6094,"Hello? Oh, Hi, Ju-- Hi, Jew! Uh huh? Uh huh? Ok. Um, sure, that'd be great. See ya then. Bye."
6095,"Did you just say Hi, Jew?"
6096,"Yes. Uh, yes, I did. That was my friend, Eddie Moskowitz. Yeah, he likes it. Reaffirms his faith."
6097,"Ben, dinner!"
6098,"Thanks Aunt Pheebs. Hey, you didn't microwave that, did you, because it's breast milk, and you're not supposed to do that."
6099,"Duh, I think I know how to heat breast milk. Ok."
6100,What did you just do?
6101,"I licked my arm, what?"
6102,It's breast milk.
6104,"Phoebe, that is juice, squeezed from a person."
6105,What is the big deal?
6107,"Ok, would people stop drinking the breast milk?"
6108,You won't even taste it?
6110,Not even if you just pretend that it's milk?
6111,Not even if Carol's breast had a picture of a missing child on it.
6112,"Hey, where is everybody?"
6113,They took Ben to the park. Where've you been?
6114,"Just out. Had some lunch, just me, little quality time with me. Thanks for your jacket."
6115,"Oh, no problem. You can borrow it, by the way. Here are your keys, hon. Mon, if uh you were at lunch alone, how come it cost you uh 53 dollars?"
6116,You know what probably happened? Someone musta stolen my credit card.
6117,And sorta just put the receipt back in your pocket
6118,That is an excellent excellent question. That is excellent.
6119,"Monica, what is with you? Who'd you have lunch with?"
6120,Judy.
6122,Julie.
6124,Jody.
6125,You were with Julie?
6126,"Look, when it started I was just trying to be nice to her because she was my brother's girlfriend. And then, one thing led to another and, before I knew it, we were...shopping."
6127,Oh. Oh my god.
6128,"Honey, wait. We only did it once. It didn't mean anything to me."
6130,"Really, Rachel, I was thinking of you the whole time. Look, I'm sorry, all right. I never meant for you to find out."
6131,"Oh, please, you wanted to get caught."
6132,That is not true!
6133,"Oh, so you just sort of happened to leave it in here?"
6134,Did it ever occur to you that I might just be that stupid?
6135,"Ok, Monica. I just have to know one thing. Did you go with her to Bloomingdales? Oh! Ok, ok, ok, I just really, uh, I just really need to not be with you right now."
6136,"Hi, who's this? Hi, Joanne. Is Rachel working? It's Monica. Yes, I know I did a horrible thing. Joanna, it's not as simple as all that, ok? No, I don't care what Steve thinks. Hi, Steve."
6137,How did we do?
6138,"Oh, I tasted Ben's milk, and Ross freaked out."
6139,I did not freak out.
6140,Why'd you freak out?
6141,Because it's breast milk. It's gross.
6142,My breast milk is gross?
6143,This should be fun.
6144,"No, no, Carol. There's nothing wrong with it. I just don't think breast milk is for adults."
6145,Of course the packaging does appeal to grown-ups and kids alike.
6146,"Ross, you're being silly. I've tried it, it's no big deal. Just taste it."
6147,That would be no.
6148,Come on. It doesn't taste bad.
6149,"Yeah, it's kinda sweet, sorta like, uh--"
6150,Cantaloupe juice.
6151,Exactly.
6152,You've tasted it? You've tasted it.
6154,"Oh, you've tasted it."
6155,"You can keep saying it, but it won't stop being true."
6156,Gimme the bottle. Gimme the towel.
6157,Howdy.
6158,"Gimme a box a juice. Well, they switched me over to Hombre."
6159,"Well, maybe it's because of the way you're dressed."
6160,"Or maybe it's because this guy's doing so good they wanna put more people on it. You should see this guy, Chandler, he goes through two bottles a day."
6161,What do you care? You're an actor. This is your day job. This isn't supposed to mean anything to you.
6162,"I know, but, I was the best, you know? I liked being the best. I don't know. Maybe I should just get outta the game. They need guys up in housewares to serve cheese."
6163,"All right, say you do that. You know sooner or later somebody's gonna come along that slices a better cheddar. And then where're you gonna run?"
6164,Yeah I guess you're right.
6165,You're damn right I'm right. I say you show this guy what you're made of. I say you stand your ground. I say you show him that you are the baddest hombre west of the lingerie.
6166,I'm gonna do it.
6167,All right. Now go see Miss Kitty and she'll fix you up with a nice hooker.
6168,I don't know what else to say.
6169,"Well that works out good, because I'm not listening."
6170,"I feel terrible, I really do."
6171,"Oh, I'm sorry, did my back hurt your Kn*fe?"
6172,"Rachel, say that I'm friends with her, we spend some time together. Is that so terrible?"
6174,It's that terrible?
6175,"Yes. Monica, you don't get it. It's bad enough that she's stolen the guy who might actually be the person that I am supposed to be with, but now, she's actually, but now she's actually stealing you."
6176,"Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could steal me from you. I mean, just because I'm friends with her doesn't make me any less friends with you. I mean, you're my...We're, we're...Oh, I love you."
6177,I love you too.
6178,"You guys, um I know that this really doesn't have anything to do with me, but um I love you guys too. Oh, I really needed that."
6179,"Look, I know that you're in a place right now where you really need to hate Julie's guts, but she didn't do anything wrong. I mean, she was just a girl who met a guy, and now they go out. I really think that if you gave her a chance, you'd like her. Would you just give that a chance, for me?"
6180,"I'd do anything for you, you know that."
6181,I'd do anything for you.
6182,"Wait, wait, wait, wait!"
6183,"Mornin'. I said, mornin'."
6184,I heard ya.
6185,"All right, everybody, I'm openin' the doors. You boys ready?"
6186,Ready.
6187,"Yeah, I'm ready."
6188,"You idiot, you stupid cowboy, you blinded me, I'm suing!"
6189,"Oh my god, Todd! What the hell did you do?"
6190,"I'm sorry. I am such a doofus. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry."
6191,"My god, what happened?"
6192,"These new kids, they never last. Sooner or later, they all...stop lastin'. Listen, uh, what do you say I buy you that cup of coffee now?"
6195,"So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?"
6196,"I know, I probably shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm pretty much totally intimidated by you."
6197,Really? Me?
6198,"Yes. Oh my god, are you kidding? Ross is so crazy about you, and I really wanted you to like me, and, it's probably me being totally paranoid, but I kinda got the feeling that maybe you don't."
6199,"Well, you're not totally paranoid."
6200,Oy.
6201,"Um, ok, uh, oh god, um, when you and uh Ross first started going out, it was really hard for me, um, for many reasons, which I'm not gonna bore you with now, but um, I just, I see how happy he is, you know, and how good you guys are together, and um, Monica's always saying how nice you are, and god I hate it when she's right."
6202,"Thanks. Hey, listen, would you like to go to a movie sometime or something?"
6203,"Yeah, that'd be great. I'd love it."
6204,"I'd love it too. sh**t, I gotta go. So, I'll talk to you later."
6205,"All right, Julie. What a manipulative bitch."
6206,Eric Aasen
6208,So how was Joan?
6209,I broke up with her.
6210,"They were huge. When she sneezed, bats flew out of them."
6211,"Come on, they were not that huge."
6212,"I'm tellin' you, she leaned back, I could see her brain."
6213,How many perfectly fine women are you gonna reject over the most superficial insignificant things?
6214,"Hold it hold it. I gotta side with Chandler on this one. When I first moved to the city, I went out a couple of times with this girl, really hot, great kisser, but she had the biggest Adam's apple. It made me nuts."
6215,You or me?
6216,"I got it. Uh, Joey, women don't have Adam's apples."
6217,"You guys are messin' with me, right?"
6219,"That was a good one. For a second there, I was like, ""whoa."""
6220,You name one woman that you broke up with for a real reason.
6221,Maureen Rosilla.
6222,Not hating Yanni is not a real reason.
6223,"Hello, Mr. Heckles."
6225,We're not doing anything.
6226,You're stomping. It's disturbing my birds.
6227,You don't have birds.
6228,I could have birds.
6229,"Ok, Mr. Heckles, we'll try to keep it down."
6230,Thank you. I'm going to rejoin my dinner party.
6231,"All right, bye-bye."
6232,"Ok, Janice. Janice. You gotta give me Janice. That wasn't about being picky."
6233,We'll give you Janice.
6234,"I miss Janice though. ""Hello, Chandler Bing."""
6235,"""Oh, my, god."""
6236,"""Oh, Chandler, now, now, that's it. There, faster!"""
6237,"Stop with the broom, we're not making noise."
6238,We won. We won!
6239,Mr. Heckles.
6240,How did this happen?
6241,He musta been sweepin'. They found a broom in his hand.
6242,That's terrible.
6243,"I know. I was sweepin' yesterday. It coulda been me.ROSS: Sure, sweepin'. You never know."
6244,You never know.
6245,"Ok, it's very faint, but I can still sense him in the building. Go into the light, Mr. Heckles!"
6246,"Ok, Phoebe."
6247,"I'm sorry, but sometimes they need help. That's fine. Go ahead and scoff. You know, there're a lot of things that I don't believe in, but that doesn't mean they're not true."
6248,Such as?
6249,"Like crop circles, or the Bermuda triangle, or evolution?"
6250,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. What, you don't, uh, you don't believe in evolution?"
6251,Nah. Not really.
6252,You don't believe in evolution?
6253,"I don't know, it's just, you know...monkeys, Darwin, you know, it's a, it's a nice story, I just think it's a little too easy."
6254,"Too easy? Too...The process of every living thing on this planet evolving over millions of years from single-celled organisms, too easy?"
6255,"Yeah, I just don't buy it."
6256,"Uh, excuse me. Evolution is not for you to buy, Phoebe. Evolution is scientific fact, like, like, like the air we breathe, like gravity."
6257,"Ok, don't get me started on gravity."
6258,"You uh, you don't believe in gravity?"
6259,"Well, it's not so much that you know, like I don't believe in it, you know, it's just...I don't know, lately I get the feeling that I'm not so much being pulled down as I am being pushed."
6260,"Uh-Oh. It's Isaac Newton, and he's pissed."
6261,"There she is. And over there, that's the other one. This is Mr. Buddy Boyle, Mr. Heckles' attorney. He'd like to talk to you."
6262,What can we do for you?
6263,"All right, kids. Here's the deal. According to my client's will, he wants to leave all his earthly possessions to ""the noisy girls in the apartment above mine""."
6264,"Well, what about his family?"
6265,He didn't have any.
6266,"Ok, so let's talk money."
6267,"All right, there was none. Let's talk signing. You be noisy girl number one, you be noisy girl number two."
6268,"I can't believe that this whole time we thought he hated us. I mean, isn't it amazing how much you can touch someone's life, without even knowing it?...Would you look at this dump? He hated us. This is his final revenge!"
6269,Have you ever seen so much crap?
6270,"Actually, I think this apartment sullies the good name of crap"
6271,Check this out. Can I have this?
6272,How can you not believe in evolution?
6273,Just don't. Look at this funky shirt!
6274,"Pheebs, I have studied evolution my entire adult life. Ok, I can tell you, we have collected fossils from all over the world that actually show the evolution of different species, ok? You can literally see them evolving through time."
6275,Really? You can actually see it?
6276,"You bet. In the U.S., China, Africa, all over."
6277,"See, I didn't know that."
6278,"Well, there you go."
6279,"Huh. So now, the real question is, who put those fossils there, and why?"
6280,"Hey, look at this. ""My Big Book of Grievances."""
6281,"Hey, there's me! April 17th. Excessive noise. Italian guy comes homes with a date. Hey Chandler, look, you're in here too."
6282,"April 18th, excessive noise. Italian guy's gay roommate comes home with the dry-cleaning. Well that's excellent."
6283,"Monica, Monica, look at this lamp. Is this tacky or what? We have to have this."
6284,"Rache, I think we have enough regular lamps."
6285,"What? Come on, it's not like I'm asking for this girly clock or anything, which, by the way, I also think is very cool."
6286,It doesn't go with any of my stuff.
6287,"Well, what about my stuff?"
6288,You don't have any stuff.
6289,"You still think of it as your apartment, don't you?"
6291,"Yes you do. You think of it as your apartment, and I'm just somebody who rents a room."
6292,Mmmmm.
6293,"Ok, while you ""mmm"" on it for awhile, I'm gonna go find a place for my new lamp."
6294,"Ok, Pheebs. See how I'm making these little toys move? Opposable thumbs. Without evolution, how do you explain opposable thumbs?"
6295,Maybe the overlords needed them to steer their spacecrafts.
6296,Please tell me you're joking.
6297,"Look, can't we just say that you believe in something, and I don't."
6298,"No, no, Pheebs, we can't, ok, because--"
6299,"What is this obsessive need you have to make everyone agree with you? No, what's that all about? I think, I think maybe it's time you put Ross under the microscope."
6300,Is there blood coming out of my ears?
6301,"Check it out, check it out. Heckles' high school yearbook."
6302,"Wow, he looks so normal."
6303,He's even kind of cute.
6304,"""Heckles, you cr*ck me up in science class. You're the funniest kid in school."
6305,Funniest? Heckles?
6306,That's what it says.
6307,"Wow, Heckles was voted class clown, and so was I. He was right. Would you listen to that?"
6308,I'd call that excessive.
6311,"Heckles played clarinet in band, and I played clarinet. And he was in the scale modeler's club, and I was, well, there was no club, but I sure thought they were cool."
6312,"So, you were both dorks. Big deal."
6313,"I just think it's weird, you know? Heckles and me, Heckles, and me, me and Heckles...Would you knock it off?"
6314,Have you been here all night?
6315,"Look at this. Pictures of all the women that Heckles went out with. Look what he wrote on them. Vivian, too tall. Madge, big gums. Too loud, too smart, makes noise when she eats. This is, this is me. This is what I do. I'm gonna end up alone, just like he did."
6316,"Chandler, Heckles was a nut case."
6317,"Our trains are on the same track, ok? Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction."
6318,"All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go."
6319,"What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it ""supposably""?"
6320,"Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody."
6321,How do you know that? How?
6322,"I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out."
6323,"You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?"
6324,"Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?"
6325,"Yeah, I understand."
6326,"You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?"
6327,You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.
6328,Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.
6329,"Hi, it's me."
6330,"Oh, my, god."
6331,Janice? You called Janice?
6332,"Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?"
6333,"You remember Janice, right?"
6334,"Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody."
6335,Helloo!!
6336,"Oh, my, god!"
6337,"Geez, look how fat she got."
6338,"Hey, it's everybody."
6339,"Janice, you're--"
6340,"Yes, I am."
6341,Is it--?
6342,"Is it yours? Ha! You wish, Chandler Bing. You are looking at a married lady now."
6343,Congratulations.
6344,"Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry."
6345,You couldn't have told me about this on the phone?
6346,And what? Missed the expression on your face? Janice likes to have her fun.
6347,"Hey, Rache. You know what we haven't played in a while?"
6349,Hide the Lamp.
6350,"Monica, let it go."
6351,Did you know I was allergic to shellfish?
6352,"Well, then, you'll just have to eat the other lamps."
6353,Uh-oh. It's Scary Scientist Man.
6354,"Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old."
6355,"Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities."
6356,"It's the only possibility, Phoebe."
6357,"Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?"
6358,"There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility."
6359,I can't believe you caved.
6361,"You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?"
6362,I am. Let me just get my coat.
6363,"Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke."
6364,"Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?"
6365,"Phoebe, tell her!"
6366,"Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you."
6367,Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.
6368,Neat. I'm gonna die alone.
6369,"Ok, you win."
6370,"Chandler, you're not gonna die alone."
6371,"Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake."
6372,Uh huh. Why is that?
6373,"If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, y=know. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. ""Run away from Crazy Snake Man,"" they'll shout!"
6374,You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.
6375,"Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there."
6376,"Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with."
6377,You are not a freak. You're a guy.
6378,She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.
6379,"Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different."
6380,In a bad way?
6381,"No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone."
6382,Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.
6383,"Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!"
6384,You made it!
6385,You're there!
6386,You are ready to make a commitment!
6387,Whoa! Don't know about that.
6388,What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?
6389,"No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment."
6392,"Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing."
6393,"Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?"
6394,I'll take that.
6395,You want his yearbook?
6396,"Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it."
6397,"Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell."
6398,It's really not that big!
6399,"Takin' that with you, huh?"
6401,You comin'?
6402,"Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down."
6403,"Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see ""Philosopher wanted""?"
6404,Sure. 
6405,"Mom, would you relax. That was 10 blocks from here and, the, the woman was walking alone at night, I would never do that. Mom, c'mon, stop worrying. This is a safe street, this is a safe building, there's nothing  OH MY GOOOD, oh my God, oh I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go.  OK, that's fine, you just read the paper, I'm gonna get a pot, it's not for you.  OK, that's fine, read the Family Circus, enjoy the gentle comedy.  Aaahh, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, aaaaahh.  It's open you guys."
6407,"Hi, hi can I help you?"
6408,"Yeah, I'm looking for Phoebe, does she still live here?"
6409,"Uh, no she doesn't but I can, I can get a message to her."
6410,"Great. Uhh, just tell her her husband stopped by. "
6412,"Hey, how, how did you do that?"
6413,"This is unbelievable Phoebs, how can you be married?"
6414,"Well, I mean, I'm not married married, ya know, he's just a friend and he's gay and he's just from Canada and he just needed a green card."
6415,"I can't believe you married Duncan. I mean how could you not tell me? We lived together, we told each other everything."
6416,"I'm sorry Monica but I knew if I told you, you'd get really, like, judgemental and you would not approve."
6417,"Of course I wouldn't approve, I mean, you were totally in love with this guy who, hello, was gay. I mean, what the hell were you thinking?"
6418,"You see, and you thought she'd be judgemental."
6419,"OK, I wasn't in love with him and I was just helping out a friend."
6420,"Please, when he left town you stayed in your pajamas for a month and I saw you eat a cheeseburger."
6421,Huuh.
6422,"Well, didn't you?"
6423,I might have.
6424,I can't believe you didn't tell me.
6425,"Oh, c'mon, like you tell me everything."
6426,What have I not told you?
6427,"Oh, I don't know. Umm, how about the fact that the underwear out there on the telephone pole is yours from when you were having sex with Fun Bobby out on the terrace."
6428,What!
6429,"Wait a minute, who told you?  You are dead meat."
6430,I didn't know it was a big secret.
6431,"Oh it's not big, not at all, you know, kinda the same lines as, say, oh I don't know, having a third nipple."
6432,You have a third nipple?
6433,You bitch.
6434,"Whip it out, whip it out."
6435,"C'mon, there's nothin' to see, it's just a tiny bump, it's totally useless."
6436,"Oh as, as opposed to your other multi-functional nipples?"
6437,I can't believe you. You told me it was a nubbin.
6438,"Joey, what did you think a nubbin was?"
6439,"I don't know, you see somethin', you hear a word, I thought that's what it was. Let me see it again."
6440,"Yeah, show it. Show it. The nubbin, the nubbin, the nubbin."
6441,Joey was in a p*rn movie.
6443,"If I'm goin' down, I'm takin' everybody with me."
6444,You were in a p*rn?
6445,"Ahh, alright, alright, alright, I was young and I just wanted a job, OK. But at the last minute I couldn't go through with it so they let me be the guy who comes in to fix the copier but can't 'cause there's people havin' sex on it."
6446,That is wild.
6447,So what's it shaped like?
6448,"Yeah, is there a hair on it?"
6449,What happens if you flick it?
6450,"So, uh, does it do anything, you know, special?"
6451,"Why yes Ross, pressing my third nipple opens the delivery entrance to the magical land of Narnia."
6452,"You know, in some cultures having a third nipple is actually a sign of virility. You get the best huts and women dance naked around you."
6453,"Huh? Are, uh, any of these cultures, per chance, in the tri-state area?"
6454,"You know, you are so amazing, is there anything you, you don't know?"
6455,"Ooh, Julie's so smart, Julie's so special."
6456,"Look honey, I wanted you to hook up with Ross as much as you did. But he's with her now and you're just gonna have to get over it."
6457,"Ohh, I'm gonna have to get over it. God, see I didn't know that's I had to do, I just have to get over it."
6458,Woah.
6459,Foxy lady.
6460,Where you goin'?
6461,"Um, I'm gonna go meet Duncan, he's skating tonight at the Garden, he's in the Capades."
6462,The Ice Capades?
6463,"No, no the gravel capades. Yeah, the turns aren't as fast but when Snoopy falls. . . funny."
6464,"I can't believe you're dressing up for him. I mean, you're just, you're setting yourself up all over again."
6465,"OK, no. For your information I'm going to see him so I can put all those feeling behind me. OK, and the reason I'm dressed like this is because I think it's nice to look nice for your gay husband."
6466,"Oh, darnit, we're all out of milk.  Hey Chandler, would you fill me up here?"
6467,"Oh I see, I see, because of the third nipple thing. Ha ha ha ha. . . "
6468,"OK sweetie, I'll see you later."
6469,See you later Rach.
6470,Bye-bye Julie. 
6473,"Hey, c'mon, cut it out."
6474,Hey?
6476,Can I ask you somethin'?
6478,Naa.
6479,"What? C'mon, talk to me."
6480,"OK, what's the longest you've been in the relationship before ha, have, having the sex?"
6481,"Why? Who's not having. . . Are you and Julie not, are, are you and, are you and Julie not having sex?"
6482,"Technically, huh, no."
6483,"Wow. Is it, is it 'cause she's so cold in bed. Or, or is it 'cause she's like, kinda bossy, makes it feel like school?"
6484,"No, no, she's great and it's not like we haven't done anything. I mean, uh, uh, we, we do plenty of other stuff, lot's of other stuff, like uhh. . ."
6485,"No, no no no, don't need to know the details."
6486,"It's just, it's, it's me. You, you know I've only been with one woman my whole life and she turned out to be a lesbian. So now I've got myself all psyched out, you know, and it's become, like this, this thing and I. . . Well, you just must think I'm weird."
6487,"No, no, no, no I don't think it's weird, I think, I think umm, in fact, in fact you know what I think?"
6489,I think it's sexy.
6490,Sexy?
6491,Let me tell you something. As a woman there is nothing sexier than a man who does not want to have sex.
6492,No kidding?
6493,Oh yeah. In fact you know what I'd do?
6495,I'd wait.
6496,You'd wait?
6497,"Yes, absolutely. I would wait and wait. . . then I'd wait some more."
6499,"Oh yeah, I don't care how much she tells you she wants it, I don't care if begs, she pleads, she tells you she, she's gonna have sex with, with another man. That just means it's working."
6500,Women really want this?
6501,More than jewelry. 
6503,Phoebe!
6504,Ta-da.
6507,"Ahh, look at you, you look great."
6508,"Do I? Thank you, so do you."
6510,"Sparkly. So, wow, this is pretty wonerful, huh. Mr. major capades guy. I, I remember when you were just, like, King Friday in Mr. Roger's Ice is Nice."
6511,You always said I'd make it.
6512,"Yeah, well, ya know, I'm kind of spooky that way. Wooo."
6513,I missed you.  I'm gonna get changed.
6515,"Um, now. Phoebs."
6516,"Oh, right, OK. Ole."
6518,"Um, the matador.  Ole, ha ha ha."
6519,"Julie, can you hold this for a second, thanks. "
6520,"Uh, Julie."
6522,"Sorry, you had a paleontologist on your face. But, uh, it's gone now, you're alright."
6525,"I just, I wanted to thank you for our uh, our little talk before."
6526,"Oh, God, no problem. So you're gonna go with the uh, waiting thing?"
6527,"Well, I was going to, but after I talked to you, I talked to Joey."
6528,"What did, what did he say?"
6529,"Basically he told me to get over myself and just do it, ya know. So I though about what you said and I though about what he said and, well, his way I get to have sex tonight so. . ."
6530,What's this in my pocket? Why it's Joey's p*rn movie.
6531,Pop it in.
6532,"I'm fine with it, I mean, if you're OK watching a video filled with two nippled people. "
6533,"Great, people having sex, that's just what I need to see."
6534,What's wrong with people having sex?
6535,"Well, well um, you know, these movies are offensive and uh, degrading to women and females. And uh, and the lighting's always unflattering. And, Monica help me out here."
6536,"Hell, I wanna see Joey."
6537,"So is there like a story or do they just stard doing it right. . . oh, never mind."
6538,"OK, now wait a minute. That is the craziest typing test I've ever seen."
6539,"All I say is, she better get the job."
6540,Looks to me like he's the one getting the job.
6541,"Shh, OK, here I come, here I come. See I'm comin' to fix the copier, I can't get to the copier, I'm thinkin' what do I do, what do I do. . . so I just watch 'em have sex. And then I say, wait, here's my line,  you know that's bad fo r the paper tray."
6542,Nice work my friend.
6543,"Thank you. Wait wait wait wait, you see me again. Hang on, the guy's butt's blockin' me. There I am, there I am, there I am, there I am, there I am. . ."
6544,"So um, so what's up, you came to see me yesterday."
6545,"Oh, yeah, um, alright, I kinda need a divorce."
6546,Ohh. . .K. How come?
6547,"Umm, actually, I'm getting married again."
6549,"Oh God, I don't know how to tell you this. I'm straight."
6551,"Yeah, I know, I."
6552,"I, I don't, I don't understand, how can you be straight? I mean, you're, you're so smart and funny and you throw such great Academy Award parties."
6553,"I know, that's what I kept telling myself but you just reach a point where you can't live a lie anymore."
6554,So how long have you known?
6555,"Well I guess on some level I always knew I was straight. I though I was supposed to be something else, you know, I'm an ice dancer, all my friends are gay, I was just tryin' to fit in."
6556,"And um, and there's actually a, a woman?"
6557,Her name's Debra.
6558,"Oh. Well is she, is she the first that you've been with?"
6559,"Well, I've never told you this but, there were one or two times, back in college, when I'd get really drunk, go to a straight bar and wake up with a woman next to me. But I, I, I told myself it was the liquor and e-everyone experiments in college. "
6561,"But now I know I don't have a choice about this, I was born this way."
6562,"I, I don't know what to say. I mean, you know, you're married to someone for six years and you think you know him and then one day says, 'Oh, I'm not gay.'"
6563,"I'm, I'm still me."
6564,Why couldn't you have just figured this out six years ago?
6565,"You know, it still smells like monkey in there."
6566,That saves us a conversation.
6567,"Well, listen, this has been great but I'm officially wiped."
6568,"Me too, we should get goin'."
6569,"No, no, I mean, no, c'mon you guys, I mean, c'mon look it's only eleven thirty. Let's just talk, we never just hang out and talk anymore."
6570,"Rachel, that's all we do."
6571,"Maybe that's all we do, what about Julie?"
6572,What about Julie?
6573,"Well, you have been in our lives for nearly two months now and we don't really know you. I mean, who is Julie? I mean, what do you like, what don't you like? We wanna hear everything."
6574,"Well, that could take a while."
6575,"So. I mean, who here does not have the time to get to know Julie?"
6576,I got the time to get to know Julie.
6577,I got time.
6578,"Rach, I know her pretty well, can I go?  That's fine."
6579,"OK Julie, so now let's start with your childhood, what was that like?"
6580,"Well, in a nutshell. . ."
6581,"Nah, uh, uh, uh, uh."
6582,"So, um, have you told your parents?"
6583,"No, but it'll be OK, they're pretty cool, my brother's straight so. . ."
6584,"Here you go. You know what, I just have one more question, um, if you had figured this out sooner and um, I had been around, do you think that I would have been the one who. . . no, um, I'm sorry, don't tell me, I don't th ink either answer would make me feel better."
6585,I love you Phoebe. 
6586,So your brother's straigh huh? Seriously.
6587,"And my second grade teacher was Ms. Thomas, and my first grade teacher was Mrs. Cobb."
6588,"Mrs., Mrs. Gobb?"
6589,"No Cobb, as in cobb salad."
6590,"Now, what exactly is in a cobb salad?"
6591,I'm goin' home.
6593,"Boy that Julie's a talker, huh?"
6595,"So, it's pretty late, you're probably uh, not still planning on. . ."
6596,"Oh, no no, I am."
6597,"Oh, well, are hey, are you nervous?"
6598,"Um, no, I uh, I have done it before."
6599,"Uh, OK, I mean uh, what, how are you gonna handle it. I mean, are, are ya gonna, are ya gonna talk about it before hand, are you just gonna pounce?"
6600,"I uh, I don't know, I guess I'm just gonna see, see what happens."
6601,"OK, gook luck."
6602,"Wha, uhh, what?"
6603,"Nothing, I mean, um, it is your first time with her and, you know if the first time doesn't go well, well then that's, that's pretty darn hard to recover from."
6604,"OK, now I'm nervous."
6605,Maybe you should put it off.
6606,"No, no, I don't wanna put it off, I just, God I just, I spent last year being so unbelievably miserable, ya know, and now, now I'm actually happy. You know, I mean, really happy. I just, I just don't wanna, I don't wanna mess it up, ya know."
6607,"I know, yeah, sorry."
6608,"What, it's not your fault."
6609,"Maybe it, maybe it doesn't have to be this tough. I mean, maybe you were on the right track with this whole, you know, spontaneous thing. I mean, women really like that."
6611,"Yeah, I mean, you know it, I mean, if it were me I, I, you know, I'd want you to, I don't know, like catch me off guard, you know, with like a really good kiss, you know really, sort of um, soft at first, then maybe um brush the hair away from my face, and look far into my eyes in a way that let's me know that something amazing is about to happen."
6613,"And then, I don't know, I mean you'd pull me really close to you so that, so that I'd be pressed up, you know, right against you. And, um, it would get kind of sweaty and uh, and blurry, and then it's just happening."
6614,"Ohh. . . Thanks Rach, goodnight. "
6615,"Ohh, God."
6616,Good morning.
6617,"Well, somebody got some last night."
6619,"Man, I sure miss Julie."
6620,"Spanish midgets. Spanish midgets wrestling. Julie. Ok, yes, I see how you got there. "
6621,You ever figure out what that thing's for?
6622,"No, see, I'm trying this new screening thing. You know, I figure if I'm always answering the phone, people'll think I don't have a life. My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned."
6623,"Here comes the beep, you know what to do."
6624,"Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?"
6626,I got a little drunk...and naked.
6627,Bob here.
6628,What've you been up to?
6629,"Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster."
6630,Can you hold on a moment? I have another call.  I love her.
6632,I'm back.
6633,"So, are we gonna get together or what?"
6634,"Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?"
6635,"Great, I'll see you then."
6636,Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.
6637,"Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, ""hey, you're not Bob."""
6638,"I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table."
6639,Oh my god. You are pure evil.
6640,"Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this."
6641,"Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico."
6642,"Hi, Julie!"
6643,"Hi, Julie."
6644,"Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday."
6645,"Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?"
6646,"Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake."
6647,Do we need a cake?
6648,"Look guys, I know it's a little steep."
6649,"Yeah, whoosh!"
6650,But it's Ross.
6651,It's Ross.
6653,"I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing."
6654,"Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?"
6655,"You know, I think I might just."
6656,"So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?"
6657,"Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies."
6658,Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?
6659,"Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?"
6660,"Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying ""let's go here, let's go there"". Like we can afford to go here and there."
6661,"Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross."
6662,For Ross.
6663,"For Ross, Ross, Ross."
6668,"I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job."
6669,"If it's not you, this is a horrible story."
6670,"Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice."
6671,"Yeah, someplace nice.  How much do you think I can get for my kidney? "
6672,I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.
6673,"Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods."
6674,"That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness."
6675,"We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy."
6676,Go over there and tell that woman the truth.
6681,"Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something."
6682,Yes?
6683,Whoever stood you up is a jerk.
6684,How did you--?
6685,"I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?"
6687,"No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today."
6688,"Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--"
6689,Who is also in charge of purchasing.
6690,Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--
6691,Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.
6692,"Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister--"
6693,"Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!"
6694,Cool.
6695,Let's see!
6696,"That's fine, I'll just wait!"
6698,"Sorry, sorry."
6699,Monica!
6700,Are we ready to order?
6701,"Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet."
6702,"Well, when you do, just let me know. I'll be right over there on the edge of my seat."
6703,"Wow, look at these prices."
6704,"Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching."
6705,"What are these, like famous chickens?"
6706,"Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon.  I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?"
6707,"Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?"
6708,"Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number."
6709,"Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?"
6710,Do I dare ask?
6711,"Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns."
6712,That sounds great. Same for me.
6713,And for the gentleman?
6714,"Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?"
6715,"You'd think, wouldn't you? Miss?"
6716,"Ok, I will have the uh,  side salad."
6717,And what will that be on the side of?
6718,"Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?"
6719,And for you?
6720,"Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care."
6721,"I will have the uh, Cajun catfish."
6722,Anything else?
6723,"Yes, how 'bout a verse of k*lling Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?"
6724,"Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks."
6725,"Um, everyone?"
6726,"Oh, you're right, I'm sorry."
6728,"Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay."
6729,"Oh, thank you!"
6730,"So five of us is, $33.50 apiece."
6731,"No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen."
6732,"Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback."
6733,"I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just..."
6734,"Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big deal."
6735,Not for you.
6736,"All right, what's goin' on?"
6737,"Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into this right now. I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable."
6738,"Fine. All right, fine."
6740,You can tell us.
6741,"Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine."
6742,"Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you."
6744,I hear ya.
6745,We can talk about that.
6746,"Well, then...Let's."
6747,"I, I just never think of money as an issue."
6748,That's 'cause you have it.
6749,That's a good point.
6750,"So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?"
6751,"'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla."
6752,"Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?"
6753,"Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing."
6754,"If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift."
6755,G-gift? The thing's not the gift?
6756,"No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish."
6757,"Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio."
6758,"No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert."
6759,"No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together."
6760,All of us.
6761,Together.
6762,Not at the concert.
6768,"So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?"
6769,"Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?"
6770,"I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look."
6771,"Oh, it's like a skit."
6772,"Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe."
6773,Whoo!
6775,"Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you."
6776,"But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?"
6777,"By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall."
6779,"Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!"
6780,"It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat."
6781,So...Thank you.
6782,Could you be less enthused?
6783,"Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--"
6784,Like?
6785,Charity.
6786,Charity?
6787,We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.
6788,"Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big."
6789,"Actually, it makes us feel that big."
6790,"I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys."
6791,"If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel."
6792,"Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel."
6793,"Ok, we never shoulda talked about this."
6794,"I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now."
6795,Me neither.
6797,"Guys, we bought the tickets."
6798,"Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff."
6799,Why did you look at me when you said that?
6800,"Well, I guess now we can't go."
6801,"What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?"
6802,You know what? You're right.
6803,Fine.
6808,All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.
6809,Chandler!
6811,Geez! Are you ready?
6812,Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.
6813,Whoa! You had sex today?
6814,"Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming."
6816,"Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign."
6817,Still doing the screening thing?
6818,I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.
6820,"Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy."
6822,"Oh, hi."
6823,"So, uh, you met someone, huh?"
6824,"Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago."
6825,"So, uh, how was he?"
6826,Eh.
6827,Eh?
6828,"Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name."
6829,"Well, that makes me feel so good."
6830,It was just so awkward and bumpy.
6831,Bumpy?
6832,"Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it."
6833,"Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?"
6834,You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.
6835,"Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here."
6836,"So, let's go."
6837,"Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song."
6838,"Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now."
6839,"You know, the guys are probably having a great time."
6840,"Come on you guys, one more time."
6841,Ok. One.
6842,Nooo.
6843,That was amazing!
6844,"Excellent, that was excellent."
6845,I can't believe the guys missed this.
6846,"What guys? Oh, yeah."
6847,"Excuse me, you're Monica Geller aren't you?"
6848,Do I know you?
6849,You used to be my babysitter.
6850,"Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?"
6851,"Good, good, I'm a lawyer now."
6852,You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.
6853,"Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage."
6854,"Uh, wait, backstage?"
6855,"Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band."
6858,"How are you? Look, you guys wanna meet the group? Come on. So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?"
6859,"Hey, you guys."
6860,Happy birthday.
6861,"Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?"
6862,"Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?"
6863,"Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?"
6864,"Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?"
6865,"Uh, good."
6866,"Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust."
6867,"Yeah, we really missed you guys."
6868,"Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid."
6869,"We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?"
6870,"No, I just, I fell down."
6871,On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?
6872,"You know, a party, or--"
6873,What party?
6874,"It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band."
6875,You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?
6876,"Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this."
6877,Who gave you that hickey?
6878,That would be the work of a Blowfish.
6880,"Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, ""hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck""."
6881,"Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know."
6882,"What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?"
6883,It's work.
6884,I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.
6885,And we don't work hard?
6886,"Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page."
6887,I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.
6888,And you feel like we hold you back.
6892,"Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired."
6894,Here's your check. That'll be $4.12.
6895,Let me get that.  You got five bucks?
6897,"Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here. I mean, It has been 3 years, and you're probably seeing someone else now, but if we could just have one night together, just for old time's sake, one hot, steamy, wild night..."
6898,"Who da wenny-Benny boy? You the Wenny-wenny-Benny-Benny boy, yes. Don't cry. Don't cry. Why is he still crying?"
6899,Let me hold him for a sec. There.  Huh? There we are.
6900,Maye it's me.
6901,Don't be silly. Ben loves you. He's just being Mr. Crankypants.
6902,"You know, I once dated a Miss Crankypants. Lovely girl, kinda moody."
6903,There we go. All better. 
6904,There's my little boy. 
6905,Can I uh see something? 
6907,He hates me. My nephew hates me.
6908,"Come on, don't do this."
6909,What if my own baby hates me? Huh? What am I gonna do then?
6910,"Monica, will you stop? This is nuts. Do you know how long it's gonna be before you actually have to deal with this problem? I mean, you don't even have a boyfriend yet. Joey, she does not look fat."
6911,"Goo, goo, goo, waaah!"
6912,That is so funny. Let me see that. 
6913,"Are you ok, Ross?"
6914,I don't know. What's in this pie? 
6915,"Uh, I don't know, butter, eggs, flour, lime, kiwi-- "
6916,Kiwi? Kiwi? I thought it was a key lime pie.
6917,"No I didn't, I said kiwi lime. That's what makes it so special. "
6918,And that's what's gonna k*ll me. I'm allergic to kiwi.
6919,"No you're not. You're, you're allergic to lobster and peanuts and--oh my god."
6920,Ugh.
6922,Ugh. It's definitely getting worse.
6923,Is your tongue swelling up?
6924,Either that or my mouth is getting smaller.
6925,"All right, get your coat, we're going to the hospital."
6926,Is he gonna be ok?
6927,"Yeah, he's just gotta get a sh*t."
6928,"You know, you know, actually it's getting better. It is. It is. Let's not go. Anyone for Thcrabble?"
6929,Jacket now.
6930,What about Ben? We can't bring a baby to a hospital.
6931,We'll watch him.
6932,I don't think tho.
6933,"What? I have seven Catholic sisters. I've taken care of hundreds of kids. Come on, we wanna do it, don't we?"
6934,"I was looking forward to playing basketball, but I guess that's out the window."
6935,"Ok, well, if you do take him out for his walk, you might wanna bring his hat, and there's extra milk in the fridge, and there's extra diapers in the bag."
6936,"Hat, milk, got it."
6937,???  Thro up a thro thro--a thro thro!
6938,Consider it done.
6939,You understood that?
6940,"Yeah, my uncle Sal has a really big tongue."
6941,Is he the one with the beautiful wife?
6942,"Hey Rach, wanna hear the new song I'm thinkin' of singing this afternoon? I wrote it this morning in the shower."
6944,"I'm in the shower and I'm writing a song. Stop me if you've heard it. My skin is soapy, and my hair is wet, and Tegrin spelled backward is Nirget."
6945,"Uh, Rachel, sweetheart, could I see ya for a minute?"
6947,F.Y.I.. I've decided to pay a professional musician to play in here on Sunday afternoons. Her name is Stephanie... something. She's supposed to be very good.
6948,But what about Phoebe?
6949,"Rachel, it's not that your friend is bad, it's that she's so bad, she makes me want to put my finger through my eye into my brain and swirl it around."
6950,"Ok, ok, so you're not a fan, but I mean, come on, you cannot do this to her."
6951,Uh--
6952,"Oh, no no no no. Oh no no no no. I have to do this to her?"
6953,"Lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, and lather, rinse, repeat, as needed."
6954,"You know, I don't think we brought enough stuff. Did you forget to pack the baby's anvil?"
6955,"It's gonna be worth it. It's a known fact that women love babies, all righ? Women love guys who love babies. It's that whole sensitive thing. Quick, aim him at that pack o' babes over there. Maybe one of them will break away. No, no wait, for get them, we got one, hard left. All right, gimme the baby."
6956,"No, I got him."
6957,"No, seriously."
6958,"Oh, seriously you want him?"
6961,And who is this little cutie pie?
6962,"Well, don't, don't think me immodest, but, me?"
6963,You wanna smell him?
6964,I assume we're talking about the baby now.
6965,"Oh, yeah. He's got that great baby smell. Get a whiff of his head."
6966,I think my uterus just skipped a b*at.
6967,What'd I tell you? What'd I tell you?
6968,I think it's great you guys are doing this.
6969,"Well, we are great guys."
6970,"You know, my brother and his boyfriend have been trying to adopt for three years. What agency did you two go through?"
6971,"But, but this is my gig. This is where I play. My, my name is written out there in chalk. You know, you can't just erase chalk."
6972,"Honey, I'm sorry."
6973,"And he's going to be paying this woman? Why doesn't he just give her like a throne, and a crown, and like a, you know, gold stick with a ball on top."
6974,"Terry is a jerk, ok? That's why we're always saying ""Terry's a jerk!"" That's where that came from."
6975,"Yeah, ok. You probably did everything you could. "
6976,"Ok, you know what, lemme, let me just see what else I can do. All right, look, look. Why don't you just let her go on after Stephanie whatever-her-name-is. I mean, you won't even be here. You don't pay her. It's not gonna cost you anything.&lt; br&gt; "
6977,"I, I don't know. "
6978,"Come on, Terry, I'll even clean the cappuccino machine."
6979,You don't clean the cappuccino machine?
6980,"Of course I clean it. I mean, I,I will cleeeean it. I mean, I will cleeeean it."
6981,"Oh, all right, fine, fine, fine."
6984,Yeah. Who's workin' for you babe?
6985,Oh! Oh my god. This is so exciting. How much am I gonna get?
6987,Well you said that he's paying the people who are playing.
6988,"Oh, no, no no. I meant that he's gonna be paying that other woman beause she's a professional."
6989,"Well, I'm not gonna be the only one who's not getting paid."
6990,"Well, but Pheebs."
6991,"No, huh uh, I'm sorry, no. No, I'm not some like sloppy second, charity band. You know what, there are thousands of places in this city where people would be happy to pay to hear me play.  When I play, I play for me, I don't need your charity.  Thank you! La la la la la la la...."
6992,"Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a sh*t. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt g*n. "
6993,"Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see someone's having an allergic reaction."
6994,"Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles."
6995,Did you tell him about my thquirt g*n idea?
6996,"My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally. "
6997,"No, under these circumstances it has to be an injection, and it has to be now."
6998,Tho?
7000,"That's good, have a seat. Um, the doctor says it's gotta be a needle. You're just gonna have to be brave, ok? Can you do that for me?"
7002,"Ok. Oh boy. You are doin' so good. You wanna squeeze my hand? All right, Ross, don't squeeze it so hard. Honey, really, don't squeeze it so hard! Oh, Ross! Let go of my hand!"
7003,"That's a good plan, Joe. Next time we wanna pick up women, we should just go to the park and make out. Taxi, taxi!"
7004,"Hey, hey, look at that talent."
7005,Just practicing. You're good. Carry on.
7006,"Hey, you. He's just adorable."
7007,"Ok, but can you tell him that, because he thinks he's too pink."
7008,So what are you guys out doing today?
7009,"Oh we're not out. No, no. We're just uh, two heterosexual guys, hanging with the son of our other heterosexual friend, doin' the usual straight guy stuff."
7010,You done?
7012,"Oh, there's our stop."
7013,Get outta here. This is our stop too.
7014,You guys live around here too?
7015,"Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. We live in the building by the uh sidewalk."
7016,You know it?
7017,"Hey, look, since we're neighbors and all, what do you say we uh, get together for a drink?"
7018,"So uh, you wanna go to Marquel's?"
7019,"Oh, sure, they love us over there."
7020,Where's your baby?
7021,Ben! Ben! Ben! 
7022,"Oh, that's good. Maybe he'll hear you and pull the cord."
7023,Stop the bus! Wait! Wait! Wait! 
7024,Are you sure he didn't break it because it really hurts.
7025,"No, it's just a good bone bruise. And, right here is the puncture wound from your ring."
7026,"Oh, I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Hey! Hey! I got my s's back! Which we can celebrate later. Celebrate. "
7027,"... with the double double double-jointed boy. Hey. So um, are you the professional guitar player?"
7028,Yeah. I'm Stephanie.
7029,"Right. My name was on there, but now it just says ""carrot cake"". So, um, so um, how many chords do you know?"
7030,All of them. 
7031,"Oh yeah, so you know D?"
7033,"Ok, do you know A minor?"
7035,"Ok, do you know how to go from D to A minor?"
7037,"Ok. Um, so does your guitar have a strap?"
7039,Oh. Mine does.  Stephanie knows all the chords. 
7040,"Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er."
7041,"Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again."
7042,"Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--"
7043,"Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!"
7044,"Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer."
7045,Thank you. I'd like to start with a song that I wrote for the first man I ever loved.  Zachary.
7046,You're all invited to bite me!
7047,Hi. We're the guys who called about the baby. We left the baby on ths bus. Is he here? Is he here?
7048,He's here.  I'm assuming one of you is the father.
7050,I'm him.
7051,"Actually, uh, we're both the father. "
7052,"Oh, Ben! Hey, buddy!"
7053,Please tell me you know which one is our baby.
7054,"Well, well that one has ducks on his t-shirt, and this one has clowns. And Ben was definitely wearing ducks."
7056,"Or clowns. Oh, oh wait. That one's definitely Ben. Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth."
7059,"Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off."
7060,Ahh!
7061,What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?
7062,"Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns."
7063,"Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?"
7064,You got a better idea? 
7065,"All right, call it in the air."
7066,Heads.
7067,Heads it is.
7068,Yes! Whew!
7069,We have to assign heads to something.
7070,"Right. Ok, ok, uh, ducks is heads, because ducks have heads."
7071,What kind of scary-ass clowns came to your birthday?
7074,Here. I thought you might be cold.
7076,"Whoa, look at you, you did pretty well."
7077,"Eight dollars and 27 cents. But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better."
7079,"No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang ""Su-Su-su1c1de"", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, ""Smelly Cat"", I got 25 cents and a condom. So you know, now I just feel really bad for Smelly Cat."
7080,"Well, you know, honey, I don't think everybody gets Smelly Cat. You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!"
7081,"It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money."
7082,"Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for ""Smelly Cat""."
7083,Really? From who?
7084,"Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite."
7085,"Hi. Uh, did I accidentally drop a condom in your case? It's kind of an emergency."
7086,Yeah. Here you go.
7087,"Thanks a lot. Hey Christine, I got it!"
7088,"I just wanna thank you for being there for me today. And I'm sorry I,I almost broke your hand."
7089,That's ok. I'm sorry I poisoned you.
7090,"Yeah. Hey, remember the time I jammed that pencil into your hand?"
7091,"Remember it? What do you think this is, a freckle?"
7093,"Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?"
7094,"Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb? "
7095,No. But I remember people telling me about it.
7096,I hope Ben has a little sister.
7097,Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.
7098,"I'm gonna get a new band-aid. Hey, how 'bout the time I cut the legs off your Malibu Ken?"
7099,That was you?
7100,"They, uh, were infected. He wouldn't have made it."
7101,"Aw, my little nephew. Come here, little one. There's my little baby Ben. Hey, my little boy. Hey, he's not crying."
7102,"Hey, he's not crying."
7103,Yes! There's still pie.
7104,"I'm here. How's my little boy? Want Daddy to change your diaper? So, did you have fun with Uncle Joey and Uncle Chandler today?"
7105,"Oh, yeah, he rode the bus today."
7106,"Ohhh. Big boy, riding the bus--Hey, I have a question. How come it says Property of Human Services on his butt?"
7107,"You, you are gonna love this. "
7108,Will you hold Ben for a sec? Come here. Come here.
7109,"Stay back, I've got kiwi. Run, Joey, Run!"
7110,"Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?"
7111,"No, no, no. I'm sorry. It's ""smelly cat, smel-ly cat""."
7112,"Smelly cat, smel-ly cat..."
7113,Better. Yeah.
7115,"Yeah, much better. And you know what, don't feel bad, because it's a hard song."
7117,You wanna try it again?
7118,Yeah. From the top?
7119,"Ok, there is no top. That's the beauty of Smelly Cat. Um, why don't you just follow me?"
7121,Mmmm hmmm.
7122,"Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat, it's not your fault."
7123,That's too much. Sorry.
7124,"OK, what is it about me? Do I not look fun enough? Is there something. . . repellant. . . about me?"
7125,"So, how was the party?"
7126,"Well it couldn't have been worse. A woman literally passed through me. OK, so what is it, am I hideously unattractive?"
7127,"No, you are not, you are very attractive. You know what, I go through the exact same thing. Every time I put on a little weight, I start questioning everyting."
7128,"Woah, woah, I've put on a little weight?"
7129,"No, not wieght... y'know, more like insulation."
7130,"Chandler, I'm unemployed and in dire need of a project. Ya wanna work out? I can remake you."
7131,"Oh, you know, I would, but that might get in the way of my lying around time."
7133,C'mon. Let her. Yeah.
7134,"Alright, OK, alright. But if we put on spandex and my boobs are bigger than yours, I'm goin' home."
7135,"Your boobs are fine. Look, I never should have said anything. Come here. Come here.  Oh, can't make.... hands... meet...."
7136,"OK, let's do it.  What?"
7137,"Nothing, just never seen you in little stretchy pants before."
7138,And we're changing. 
7139,C'mon give me five more. Five more.
7141,Five more and I'll flash you.
7142,"One. . . two. . . two and a half. OK, just show me one of them."
7143,"Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.  Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow. . She's insane, the woman is insane. It's before work, it's after work, it's during work. She's got me doing butt clenches at my desk. And now, they won't bring me my mail anymore."
7144,"Hey Phoebs, how'd it go with Scott last night?"
7145,"Oh, um, it was nice. Took him to a romantic restraunt, ordered champagne, nice."
7146,"The guy still won't put out, huh?"
7147,"Nope. Zilch, nothin', uh-uh."
7148,Sorry Phoebs.
7149,"Look, I, y'know, I don't mind taking it slow, I like him a lot, y'know he's really interesting and he's really sweet and why won't he give it up?"
7150,"Maybe he, uhh... drives his car on the other side of the road, if ya know what I mean."
7151,"No, whad'ya mean? He's not British."
7152,Maybe he's. . . gay.
7153,"Oohh, um, no, I don't think that's the problem. 'Cause we went, um, dancing the other night and the way he held me so close, and the way he was looking into my eyes I just like... definitely felt something."
7154,"Yeah, but how much can you tell from a look?"
7155,"No, I felt it on my hip. You could tell."
7156,"Yo, Bing. Racquetball in 15 minutes."
7157,"Joey, be a pal. Lift up my hand and smack her with it."
7158,"Ooh, oh, Rachel, don't look."
7159,"What?  C'mon you guys, I don't care, I have a date tonight."
7160,"Woah, woah, woah, you have a date?"
7161,"Yeah, Monica's settin' me up."
7162,"But uh, uh, what about uh, Ross and uh. . .?"
7163,"Oh what, my whole insane jealousy thing? Well, y'know, as much fun as that was, I've decided to opt for sanity."
7164,So you really OK about all this?
7165,"Oh yeah, c'mon, I'm movin' on. He can press her up against that window as much as he wants. For all I care, he can throw her through the damn thing."
7166,Hi guys.
7168,"Oh, Monica, I figured I'd come by tomorrow morning and pick up Fluffy's old cat toy, OK?"
7169,Only if you say his full name.
7170,Can I come over tomorrow and pick up Fluffy Meowington's cat toy.
7172,You're getting a cat?
7173,"Uh, actually, we're getting a cat."
7174,Together?
7179,"Yeah, we figure it'll live with Ross half the time, and with me half the time."
7180,"Ohh, well, isn't that just lovely. That's something the two of you will be able to enjoy for a really, really, really, really, really long time."
7181,Hopefully.
7182,"Well.  Woah, look at that! I gotta go, I gotta date. With a man. Um, OK, you guys have a really, uh, have a really good night and you two have a, uh, have a, uh, really good cat.  OK, we're not supposed to take these when we leave."
7183,"I don't know if Monica told you but this is the first date I've gone on since my divorce so, if I seem a little nervous, I am."
7184,How long do cats live?
7185,I'm sorry?
7186,"Cats, how long do they live figuring you don't... y'know, throw 'em under a bus or something?"
7187,"Um, maybe 15, 16 years."
7188,That's just great. 
7189,"Um, cheers."
7190,"Oh, right, clink. "
7191,"Monica told you I was cuter that this, didn't she?"
7192,"Oh, no, Michael, it's not you. I'm sorry, it's just, it's this thing. It's probably not as bad as it sounds but this friend of mine is, is getting a cat with his girlfriend."
7193,"Oh, that does sound. . .Ahh."
7194,I mean he just started going out with her.
7195,"Is this guy, uhh, an old boyfriend?"
7196,"Ah, hah-hah-hah-ho, yeah, he wishes. Oh, I'm sorry, look at me. OK, Michael, let's talk about you. "
7198,"OK, OK. So, you ever get a pet with a girlfriend?"
7199,"So, I figured it out."
7201,Why Scott doesn't want to sleep with me. It's 'cause I'm not sexy enough.
7202,"Phoebe, that's crazy. When I first met you, you know what I said to Chandler? I said, ""Excellent butt, great rack."""
7203,"Really? That's so sweet. I mean, I'm officially offended but, sweet."
7204,"Phoebs look, if you want to know what the deal is, you're just gonna have to ask him."
7205,"You're right, you're right. Ah, you are so yumm. "
7206,"I mean, it's a cat, y'know, it's a cat. Why can't they get one of those bugs, y'know, one of those fruitflies, those things that live for like a day or something?  What're they called, what're they called, what're they called?"
7207,Fruitflies?
7208,Yes! Thank you.
7209,"So, would you like any dessert?"
7210,"No! No dessert, just a check, please."
7211,"Oh, you're not having fun, are you?"
7212,"No, no, I am, but only because for the last hour and a half I've been playing the movie Diner in my head."
7213,"Oh, look at me, look at me. Oh, I'm on a date with a really great guy, all I can think about is Ross and his cat and his... Julie. I just want to get over him. gosh, why can't I do that?"
7214,"Oy. Look, I've been through a divorce, trust me you're gonna be fine. You just can't see it now because you haven't had any closure."
7215,"Yeah! Closure. That's what it is, that's what I need. God, you're brilliant! Why didn't I think of that? How do I get that?"
7216,"Well, you know, there's no one way really, it's just, you know, whatever it takes so that you can finally say to him, ""I'm over you."""
7217,"Closure, that's what it is. Closure.  Hello, excuse me. Excuse me, hel. . . woo "
7218,Hang on.
7219,"Hello, excuse me."
7220,What.
7221,"Hi, I'm sorry, I need to borrow your phone for just one minute."
7222,I'm talkin'!
7223,"I can see that. I... just one phone call, I'll be very quick, I'll even pay for it myself.  OK, you're bein' a little weird about your phone."
7224,"Alright, fine.  I'll call you back. "
7225,Thank you. OK.   Machine. Just waiting for the beep.
7226,Good.
7227,"Ross, hi, it's Rachel. I'm just calling to say that um, everything's fine and I'm really happy for you and your cat who, by the way, I think you should name Michael. And, you know, ya see there I'm thinking of names so obviously, I am over you. I am over you and that, my friend, is what they call closure. "
7228,"No, no, no, no, no, no  No. Monica, it's Sunday morning. I'm not running on a Sunday."
7230,Because it's Sunday. It's God's day.
7231,"OK, if you say stop, then we stop."
7232,"OK, stop."
7233,"No, c'mon, we can't stop, c'mon, we've got three more pounds to go. I am the energy train and you are on board. Woo-woo, woo-woo, woo-woo  Woo."
7235,Ahhhh.
7236,Oh. And how was the date? 
7237,"Umm, I think there was a restaurant... I know there was wine. . ."
7238,"Wow, well uh, uh, actually, Julie's downstairs getting a cab, I just need the cat toy, did Monica say. . . What? Why, why are you looking at me like that?"
7239,"I don't know, I, I feel like I had a dream about you last night but I, I don't remember."
7240,"OK. Oh, oh, oh. "
7241,Did we speak on the phone last night? Did you call me?
7242,"No, I stayed at Julie's last night."
7244,"Oh, actually I haven't even been home yet. Do you mind if I check my messages?"
7245,"Oh yeah, go ahead. "
7246,"Rach, I got a message from you.  Who's Michael?"
7247,"Oh my God. Oh my God Ross, no, hang up the phone, give me the phone Ross, give me the phone, give me the phone, give me the. . . "
7248,You're over me?
7249,Ohhhhhhhh God. 
7250,"Wha... you're uh, you're, you're over me?"
7251,"Ohh, ohh."
7252,"When, when were you... under me? Rach. Rachel do you, I mean, were you, uh. . . What?"
7253,"Ohh, OK, OK, OK, well, basically, lately, I've uh, I've uh, sort of had feelings for you."
7254,You've had feelings for me?
7255,"Yeah, what, so? You had feelings for me first."
7256,"Woah. Huh. You know about my, I mean, you know I had... you know?"
7257,Chandler told me.
7258,Chandler. When did he... when did he... when did he?
7259,When you were in China.
7260,China.
7261,Meeting Julie.
7262,"Julie. Julie. That. Oh God. Julie, right. OK, I need to lie down. No, ya know, I'm gonna stand. I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna walk, I'm walkin' and I am standing. OK so you uh, and now wha... and now, now, now you're over me?"
7263,Are you over me?
7264,"That's, that's Julie. Ju... Julie, Julie.  Hi Julie."
7265,"Hi honey, I've got a cab waiting."
7266,I'll be right down.
7267,"Wait, so, you're going?"
7268,"Well, OK, I uh, I have to. I can't deal with this right now. I mean, I've uh, y'know, I've got a cab, I've got a girlfriend, I'm... I'm gonna go get a cat."
7269,"OK, OK."
7270,Cat. 
7271,Hey Joey.
7272,Hey Phoebs.
7273,How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?
7274,I can't find the remote.  Thank you.
7275,"So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did."
7277,And we did.
7278,"All right Phoebs, way to go."
7279,Yay me.
7280,"So, so how did it happen?"
7281,"Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on."
7282,And what did he say?
7283,"He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious."
7285,"Yeah, so I said, ""OK, relax please,"" y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him."
7286,"Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea."
7287,Um-hum.
7288,This man is my God.
7290,I didn't get a cat.
7291,"Oh, that's um, interesting."
7292,"No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting."
7293,"Alright, I got it Ross."
7294,You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.
7296,I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.
7297,"Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?"
7298,Then you should have said something before I met her.
7299,I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.
7300,There was never a good time.
7301,"Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night."
7302,"Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys."
7303,"Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?"
7304,"The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed."
7305,"Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?"
7306,"Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it."
7307,"Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross."
7309,'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.
7311,Good. 
7312,"And ya know what, now I've got closure."
7313,Try the bottom one.
7314,"Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over."
7315,"No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'."
7316,"OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret."
7317,"Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?"
7318,"Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have."
7319,"Well, thanks."
7320,"I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work."
7321,"Well, you know."
7322,"You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed."
7324,And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.
7325,"Well no, but um."
7326,"I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all."
7327,"Y'know, I try to stay positive. . ."
7328,"So, you feel like goin' for a run?"
7330,"Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here."
7331,OK. Just for a little while.
7333,Ross kissed me.
7334,"Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!"
7335,It was unbelievable!
7337,"Ok, all right. We want to hear everything. Monica, get the wine and unplug the phone. Rachel, does this end well or do we need to get tissues?"
7338,"Oh, it ended very well."
7340,Do not start without me. Do not start without me.
7341,"Ok, all right, let's hear about the kiss. Was it like, was it like a soft brush against your lips? Or was it like a, you know, a ""I gotta have you now"" kind of thing?"
7342,"Well, at first it was really intense, you know. And then, oh, god, and then we just sort of sunk into it."
7343,"Ok, so, ok, was he holding you? Or was his hand like on your back?"
7344,"No, actually first they started on my waist. And then, they slid up, and then, they were in my hair."
7345,Ohhhh.
7346,"And, uh, and then I kissed her."
7347,Tongue?
7350,"All right, check out this bad boy. 12 megabytes of ram. 500 megabyte hard drive. Built-in spreadsheet capabilities and a modem that transmits at over 28,000 b.p.s."
7351,Wow. What are you gonna use it for?
7352,Games and stuff.
7353,There are no jobs. There are no jobs for me.
7354,"Wait, here's one. Uh, would you be willing to cook naked?"
7355,There's an ad for a naked chef?
7356,"No, but if you're willing to cook naked, then you might be willing to dance naked. And then... "
7358,"Hey, oh, so, um...how'd you make out last night?"
7359,"That, that is funny. That is painfully funny. No, wait. Wait, yeah, that's just painful"
7360,Wait a minute. I thought last night was great.
7361,"Yeah, it was, but...I get home, ok, and I see Julie's saline solution on my night table. And I'm thinking to myself, oh my god, what the hell am I doing? I mean, here I am, I am with Julie, this incredible, great woman, who I care about and who cares about me, and I'm like, what, am I just gonna throw all that away?"
7362,You got all that from saline solution?
7363,We are talking about Rachel here. You and Rachel.
7364,"Believe me, I've been dreaming about me and Rachel for ten years now. But now, I'm with Julie, so it's like me and Julie, me and Rachel, me and Julie, me and... ... Rachel. Rachel, Rachel."
7367,Good. How are you?
7370,"Hi, Julie.  Hi, Julie. Julie, um, how are you?"
7372,"Good, so everybody's here. Everybody's good. So, were you gonna play something, Phoebe?"
7373,"Oh, well, actually."
7374,Play it.
7375,"Ok, all right."
7376,"Hey, Julie, I didn't know you wore lenses."
7378,Ssshh.
7379,"Ok, um, hi, hello, hi, ok, so, um, this is a song about a love triangle between three people that I made up. Um, it's called, um, ""Two of Them Kissed Last Night""."
7380,"There was a girl, we'll call her Betty, and a guy let's call him Neil. Now I can't stress this point too strongly, this story isn't real. Now our Neil must decide, who will be the girl that he casts aside. Will Betty be the one who he loves truly? Or will it be the one who we'll call Ju...Loolie? He must decide, he must decide, even though I made him up, he must decide!"
7381,"This is a nice resume. Nice, nice, nice. Muy impressivo."
7382,"So, Mr. Rastatter, what exactly does this job entail? The ad wasn't too clear."
7383,Mockolate.
7385,Mockolate. It's a completely synthetic chocolate substitute.
7386,Ohh.
7387,"Go ahead. Try a piece. Yeah, we think that Mockolate is even better than chocolate."
7388,All right. Mmm-mmm.
7390,"I love how it crumbles. Now see, your chocolate doesn't do that."
7391,"No, ma'am. Well, anyhoo, we should be getting our F.D.A. approval any day now, hopefully, in time for Thanksgiving. See, the way we look at it, chocolate already dominates most of your major food-preparation holidays: Easter, Christmas, what have you."
7392,Mmm-mmm.
7393,"But, we're thinking, given the right marketing, we can make Thanksgiving the Mockolate holiday."
7395,Aren't you going to swallow that?
7396,Just waiting for it to stop bubbling.
7397,"Yeah, isn't that great?"
7398,Mmm.
7399,"Well, anyhoo, um, we are looking for a couple of chefs who can create some Thanksgiving-themed recipes. You think you might be interested?"
7400,"Abso......lutely. See, I love creating new recipes. I love Thanksgiving. And, well, now, I love Mockolate."
7402,"Especially the after taste, you know, I'll tell ya, that'll last ya till Christmas."
7403,How about Mockolate mousse?
7404,"It's not, it's not very Thanksgiving-y."
7405,"Ok, how about pilgrim Mockolate mousse?"
7406,What makes it pilgrim?
7407,We'll put buckles on it.
7411,"Did uh, Ross call?"
7412,"No, I'm sorry."
7413,"Why didn't he call? He's gonna stay with Julie, isn't he? He's gonna stay with her and she's going to be all, ""Hi, I'm Julie, Ross picked me, and we're gonna to get married, have a lot of kids and dig up stuff together."""
7414,"No offense, but that sounds nothing like her."
7415,"I don't know what to do. What am I gonna do? I mean, this, this is like a complete nightmare."
7416,"Oh, I know. This must be so hard. Oh, no. Two women love me. They're both gorgeous and sexy. My wallet's too small for my fifties, and my diamond shoes are too tight."
7417,"Hey, here's a thought, Ross. "
7418,Don't touch the computer. Don't ever touch the computer.
7419,"Ross, listen. I got two words for you. Threesome."
7420,"Ok, all right, look. Let's get logical about this, ok? We'll make a list. Rachel and Julie, pros and cons. Oh. We'll put their names in bold, with different fonts, and I can use different colors for each column."
7421,Can't we just use a pen?
7422,"No, Amish boy."
7423,"Ok, let's start with the cons, 'cause they're more fun. All right, Rachel first."
7424,"I don't know. I mean, all right, I guess you can say she's a little spoiled sometimes."
7425,You could say that.
7426,"And I guess, you know, sometimes, she's a little ditzy, you know. And I've seen her be a little too into her looks. Oh, and Julie and I, we have a lot in common 'cause we're both paleontologists, but Rachel's just a waitress."
7427,Waitress. Got it. You guys wanna play Doom? Or we could keep doing this. What else?
7429,"Oh, her ankles are a little chubby."
7430,"Ok, let's do Julie. What's wrong with her?"
7431,She's not Rachel.
7432,"Ok, this is pumpkin pie with mockolate cookie crumb crust. This is mockolate cranberry cake, and these are mockolate chip cookies. Just like the Indians served."
7434,Oh my god good?
7435,"Oh my god, I can't believe you let me put this in my mouth."
7436,"Oh, oh sweet Lord! This is what evil must taste like!"
7437,"I'm telling you this thing won't print. Yes, I pressed that button like 100 times. You know, for a hot line you are not so hot. What? What is that in the background? Are you watching Star Trek?"
7438,"Hey, so how'd it go with Julie? Did you, did you break her heart?"
7439,"Yes, it was horrible. She cried. I cried. She threw things, they hit me. Anyway, I did the right thing."
7440,"So, Spock actually hugs his father?"
7441,"Hey, do you guys have......hi."
7444,"I uh, I just got back from uh, from Julie's."
7446,"No, no, uh, it's not what you think. It's um the other thing."
7447,"Well, what's the other thing, what do I think?"
7448,"Well, uh."
7449,"He broke up with Julie. Well, go hug her, for god's sakes."
7451,"Really. It's always been you, Rach."
7454,"Oh, oh, this is good, this is really good."
7455,"I know, I know, it's, it's almost... What do you say we go take a walk, just us, not them?"
7456,Let me get my coat.
7457,"Ok. No, hey, whoa, whoa, I'll get your coat."
7458,"Ok, he's goin' to get my coat. He's goin' to get my coat. Oh my god, you guys. I can't believe this. This is unbelievable.  What's that?"
7459,What? Nothing.
7460,What's that? What? I saw my name. What is it?
7461,"No, no, see? See?  Hey, it's printing.  Hey, it's printing!"
7462,Well what is it? Let me see.
7463,"Hey, someone order a coat?"
7464,"Ross, Chandler wrote something about me on his computer and he won't let me see."
7465,"He won't?  He won't! Because, isn't that, isn't that the, the short story you were writing?"
7466,"Yes, yes it is, short story, that I was writing."
7467,And I'm in it? Then let me read it.
7470,"Hey, uh, why don't you read it to her?"
7471,"Alright.  ""It was summer, and it was hot. Rachel was there. A lonely gray couch. 'Oh, look,' cried Ned, and then the kingdom was his forever. The end."""
7472,That's it? That's all you wrote? You're the worst writer in the whole world.
7473,"All right, you know what? This isn't funny anymore. There's something about me on that piece of paper and I want to see it."
7475,"All right, you know what, that's fine. If you guys want to be children about this, that's fine. I do not need to see it. "
7476,"What is this? Ross, what is this?"
7478,"Ok, just, just remember how crazy I am about you, ok?"
7479,Kind of ditzy? Too into her looks? Spoiled?
7480,"Now that's a little spoiled. He was supposed to type ""little"", the idiot."
7481,Just a waitress?
7482,"No, that, that was, I mean, as opposed to uh, the uh, ok. Is this over yet Rach?"
7483,Oh! I do not have chubby ankles!
7484,"No, no, wait, ok, ok, look at the other side. Look at Julie's column."
7485,She is not Rachem. What the hell's a Rachem? Is that some stupid paleontology word that I wouldn't know because I'm just a waitress.
7486,"No, Rach, come on. Rach! Rach, no, no! She's not Rachel, she is, she is not, Ra--Rachel?"
7487,"My diary! My diary, that's brilliant. I should have told her it was my diary, she never would have made me read her my diary."
7488,"You know, that's true. You'd be a great person to have around the day after an emergency."
7489,I... I cannot believe Ross even made this list. What a dinkus.
7490,"Hey, cut him some slack. It was Chandler's idea."
7493,"Oh good, I was hoping that would come up."
7494,This was your idea?
7495,What were you thinking?
7496,"All right, let's get some perspective here, ok? These things, they happen for a reason."
7497,Yeah. You!
7498,"All right, Pheebs, back me up here, ok? You believe in that karma crap, don't you?"
7499,"Yeah, by the way, good luck in your next life as a dung beetle."
7500,"Rach! Whoops! Rach, hey, open up, please!"
7501,"When somebody does not buzz you in, Ross, that means go away. That doesn't mean please climb up the fire escape."
7502,I just wanna read something. It's your pro list.
7503,Not interested.
7504,"Ok, ok, number one: The way you cry at game shows. Number two: how much you love your friends. Number three: the way you play with your hair when you're nervous. Number four: how brave you are for starting your life over. Number five: how great you are with Ben."
7505,Number six: the way you smell.
7506,"Hey, Ross! What are you doin'?"
7507,"Hey, Joey. You wanna open the window?"
7508,"Oh, yeah, I do."
7509,What are you doing out there?
7510,"I am, uh, I am..."
7511,"Oh, you must be freezing. You know what you need? How about a nice steaming cup of hot Mockolate?"
7512,"Rach, come on, open up. Rach, come on, come on, Rach. You got to give me another chance."
7514,No?
7515,That's what I said.
7516,"Look, maybe we should go?"
7517,"No, you guys, you really don't have to go, we're done talking."
7518,"Rach, come on, look, I know how you must feel."
7519,"No, you don't, Ross. Imagine the worst things you think about yourself. Now, how would you feel if the one person that you trusted the most in the world not only thinks them too, but actually uses them as reasons not to be with you."
7520,"No, but, but I wanna be with you in spite of all those things."
7521,"Oh, well, that's, that's mighty big of you, Ross.  I said don't go!"
7522,"You know what? You know what? If, things were the other way around, there's nothing you could put on a list that would ever make me not want to be with you."
7523,"Well, then, I guess that's the difference between us. See, I'd never make a list."
7524,"I never know how long you're supposed to wait in this type of a situation before you can talk again, you know?  Maybe a little longer."
7525,"Now, in some of these recipes, the quantities may seem just a little unusual, uh, like these coconut mockolate holiday nut bars. I've indicated four cups of coconut, and four cups of crushed nut, and only, uh, one tablespoon of mockolate."
7526,Doesn't matter.
7528,Our FDA approval didn't come through. Something about laboratory rats.
7529,"Oh, gosh, I'm sorry."
7530,"Yeah, well, anyhoo, here is your check.  Thank you for all the trouble you went through. Um, listen, you didn't eat a lot of it while you were cooking, did you?"
7531,"Well, uh, I ate some."
7532,"Oh, some, that's fine. Some is fine. Some is not a lot. So, it doesn't burn when you pee, does it?"
7535,"Is that him again? Tell him I'd come to the phone, but my ankles are weighin' me down."
7536,"Listen, I... I don't think this is the best time."
7537,"Look, can, can you do something for me?"
7538,"Sure, what? Ok, ok.   Music?"
7539,"The next one's dedicated to Rachel from Ross. Rachel, he wants you to know he's deeply sorry for what he did and he hopes you can find it in your heart to forgive him. "
7540,"Uh, we've just gotten a call from Rachel, and she told us what Ross did. It's pretty appalling, and Ross, if you're listening, I don't wanna play your song anymore. Why don't we devote our time to a couple that stands a chance? Avery, Michelle's sorry she hit you with her car and she hopes you two will work it out."
7541,"Hi, thanks for coming in again."
7542,"Oh, not at all. I have no morals and I need the cash."
7543,"It's like I'm lookin' in a mirror. Anyway, they're called ""fishtachios"". They taste exactly like pistachios, but they're made primarily of reconstituted fish bits. Here, try one. You're not allergic to anything, are you?"
7544,Cat hair.
7546,"Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Ugly Naked Guy is decorating his tree. Oh my God, you should see the size of his Christmas Balls."
7550,"Hey, how much did you guys tip the super this year?"
7551,"Yeah, we were gonna give fifty, but if you guys gave more, we don't wanna look bad."
7552,"Oh, actually this year we just made him homemade cookies."
7553,And twenty-five it is.
7554,You gave him cookies?
7555,"Money is so impersonal. Cookies says someone really cares. . . Alright, we're broke, but cookies do say that."
7556,I can see that. A plate of brownies once told me a limerick.
7557,"Phoebs, let me ask you something, were, were these, uh, funny brownies?"
7558,"Not especially. But you know what, I think they had pot in them."
7559,"So you guys, who else did you tip with cookies?"
7560,"Uhh, the mailman, the super."
7561,"Oh, and the newspaper delivery guy."
7564,"Uhhh, I don't think you're gonna like this."
7565,"Ooh, goooosh, ooh, these are cookies smashed in the sports section."
7566,"Oh look, and he did my crossword puzzle."
7567,"Yeah, but not very well, unless 14-across, 'Gershwin musical' actually is bitemebitemebitemebiteme."
7568,"I can't believe it's Christmas already. Ya know, I mean, one day your eatin' turkey, the next thing ya know, your lords are a-leapin' and you geese are a-layin'."
7569,Which is why geese are so relaxed this time of year.
7570,Hey guys.
7572,"Hey Rach. I, uh, got you a little present. . . I'll open it. It's a Slinky! Remember, huh.  Walks down stairs, alone or in pairs, everyone knows it's. . . just a big spring. Alright, you still mad at me becuase of the whole. . ."
7573,Horrible and degrading list of reasons not to be with me?
7574,"How 'bout from now on we just call it the 'unfortunate incident'?  Hey g*n, you got stairs in your place?"
7576,"Here, go nuts. "
7579,What's in the bag?
7580,"Um, just some presents."
7581,C'mon show us what you bought. . . You know you want to.
7582,"OK. OK, this is a picture frame from Ben to my parents, huh."
7583,Cute.
7584,"I got some, uh, hers and hers towels for Susan and Carol. And, uh, I got this blouse for mom."
7585,"Ross, that is gorgeous!"
7587,"Look at these authentic fake medals. I tell ya, mom's gonna be voted best dressed at the make-believe m*llitary academy."
7589,Hey. Hi Phoebe.
7590,"Happy Christmas Eve Eve.  Oh my God, where did you get this?"
7591,"Uh, Macy's, third floor, home furnishings."
7592,"This is my father, this is a picture of my dad."
7593,"Nah, Phoebs, that's the guy that comes in the frame."
7594,"No it isn't, this is my dad, alright, I'll show you."
7595,"Phoebe, I thought your dad was in prison."
7596,"No, that's my stepdad. My real dad's the one that ran out on us before I was born."
7597,How have you never been on Oprah?
7598,"OK, look, see, this is him. My mother gave me this picture before she d*ed, same guy."
7599,"Honey, uh, this is a picture of the frame guy posing in front of a bright blue screen with a collie."
7600,"It's not a blue screen... it's just, maybe it was just really clear that day. OK, I have to talk to my grandmother. "
7601,"Oh, wait a minute honey."
7602,Phoebs. 
7604,"So anyway, I'm trying to get my boss's ex-wife to sleep with me. . ."
7606,"Oh, but when Phoebe has a problem, everyone's all ears!"
7607,Esther Livingston.  Gone.
7608,"Hi, Phoe."
7609,Hi Gram. Whatcha doin'?
7610,"Oh, just updating the phonebook."
7611,"Um, gram, um, can I see the pictures of my dad again?"
7612,"Oh. Oh, sure, sure, uh, uh, how come?"
7613,"Just, you know, to see... um."
7614,"Oh, sure, yeah.  This is the one of you father in a meadow, and, uh, helping a little boy fly a kite, and here he is at a graduation. . . another graduation. . . another graduation."
7615,"OK, is this really my father?"
7616,Is it really your fa--I can't... well of course it is.
7617,"OK, I smell smoke. Maybe that's 'cause someone's pants are on fire."
7618,"Look, I. . ."
7619,"Ya know, in all the years that we have been grandmother and granddaughter, you have never lied to me."
7620,"Alright, that is not your father, that's just a picture of a guy in a frame."
7622,"It was your mother's idea. Ya know, she didn't want you to know your real father because it hurt her so much when he left, and, I didn't want to go along with it, but, well then she d*ed and, and it was harder to argue with her. Not impossible, but harder."
7623,"Alright, so, what, he's not a famous tree surgeon? And then, I guess, OK, he doesn't live in a hut in Burma where there's no phones?"
7624,"Last I heard, he was a pharmacist somewhere upstate."
7625,"OK, that makes no sense. Why would the villagers worship a pharmacist?"
7626,Honey.
7628,"Anyway, that's all I know. That, and this.  This is the real him."
7630,"Ya know I remember my father, all dressed up in the red suit, the big black boots, and the patent leather belt, sneakin around downstairs. He didn't want anybody to see him but he'd be drunk so he'd stumble, crash into something and wake everybody up."
7631,"Well, that doesn't sound like a very merry Christmas."
7632,Who said anything about Christmas?
7634,"Hey, anyone hear from Phoebe yet?"
7635,"No, nothin'."
7636,I hope she's OK.
7637,"Yeah, I know exactly what she's goin' through."
7638,How do you know exactly what she's going through?
7639,She told us.
7640,So whaddya got there Monica?
7641,Just some stuff for the party.
7642,"Yeah, what're you guys doin' here, aren't you supposed to be Christmas shopping?"
7643,"You guys haven't gotten your presents yet? Tomorrow's Christmas Eve, what're ya gonna do?"
7644,Don't you have to be Claymation to say stuff like that?
7645,"Oh, by the way Mon, I don't think the mailman liked your cookies. Here are the ornaments your mom sent. "
7646,"Well, maybe the mailman liked the cookies, we just didn't give him enough."
7647,"Monica, pigeons learn faster that you."
7648,"Hey, Rach, you know what? I think, I think I know what'll make you feel better. How 'bout you make a list about me."
7649,"Wha... forget it Ross, no, I am not gonna stand here and make a list of. . ."
7650,C'mon Rachel.
7651,"OK, you're whiney, you are, you're obsessive, you are insecure, you're, you're gutless, you know, you don't ever, you don't just sort of seize the day, you know. You like me for what, a year, you didn't do anything about it. And, uh, oh, you wear too much of that gel in your hair."
7652,"See there, you uhh, alright, ya, you did what I said."
7653,"Yeah, and you know what? You're right, I do feel better, thank you Ross. "
7654,"Yeah, um, in Albany, can I have the number of Frank Buffay. . . OK, um, in Ithica. . . alright, um, Saratoga. . . Oneonta. Alright, you know what, you shouldn't call youself information. "
7656,"Hello grandma, if that is in fact your real name."
7657,"C'mon now Phoe, don't still be mad at me. How's it going?"
7658,"Well, not so good. Upstate's pretty big, he's pretty small, you do the math."
7659,"Well, I think you're better off without him. Oh honey, I know he's your daddy but, but to me he's still the irresponsible creep who knocked up your mom and stole her Gremlin."
7660,"No I just, just wanted to know who he was, ya know."
7661,"I know. OK, I wasn't completely honest with you when I told you that, uh, I didn't know exactly where he lived."
7662,Whattaya mean?
7663,"He lives at 74 Laurel Drive in Middletown. If you hit the Dairy Queen, you've gone too far. You can take my cab."
7664,Wow. Thank you.
7665,"Now, remember, nobody else drives that cab."
7666,"Uh-huh, got it. Ooh, I'm gonna see my dad. Wish me luck, Grandpa! "
7667,Phoebe here with the cab yet?
7668,"Yeah, she, she brought the invisible cab. . . hop in."
7669,"Well she better get here soon, the outlet stores close at 7."
7670,"Hey, don't worry. I figure it'll be 2 hours to Phoebe's dad's house, they'll meet, they'll chat, they'll swap life stories, we'll still have plenty of time."
7671,"Hey, here she comes."
7676,"Can you believe this. In, like, two hours I'm gonna have a dad. Eeeshk."
7677,Eeeshk.
7678,"Yeah, big stuff."
7679,"OK, let's go."
7681,"Alright, here, you have to hold this. "
7682,"OK.  Brake left, gas right?"
7683,"Uh-huh, yeah, that's my cheat sheet."
7684,Where's my seat belt?
7685,"Oh, no no, that side doesn't have one, the paramedics had to cut through it. "
7688,"C'mon, just tell me, please, please."
7689,"For the sixteenth time, no... I do not think you're obsessive."
7690,"Oh, gosh, it's hot in here."
7691,"Rach, get the heat.  Ross, could you turn the heat down please?"
7692,"Sure. By the way, there's a difference between being obsessive and. . ."
7693,"Ross, the heat!"
7694,"Fine, OK! Heat, heat, heat, and I'm the obsessive one.  OK, this way is on, so this is. . .  off."
7695,Did you just break the radiator?
7696,"No, no, I was turnin' the knob and, and. . . here it is."
7697,Well put it back.
7698,"It uhh, it won't go back."
7699,I'll call the super.
7700,"Here, let me try."
7701,"Oh, oh that's right, I forgot about your ability to fuse metal."
7702,"Hey, it's Funny's cousin, Not Funny."
7703,"Hi, Mr. Treeger. Hi, it's Rachel Green from upstairs. Yes, somebody, uh, broke our knob on the radiator and it's really hot in here. Yes, it's, it's hot enough to bake cookies. Well, do you think we could have a new one by 6? Wha t, no, no, Tuesday, we can't wait until Tuesday, we're having a party tonight."
7704,"OK, tip the man."
7705,"No, if he doesn't like our cookies, too bad, I am not gonna be blackmailed. Look if worse comes to worse, it gets a little warm, we'll call it a theme party."
7706,"Hey, here's a theme: Come on in, live like bacon."
7707,"Ooh, this is it, 74. "
7708,"Oh, so that's what this is for."
7709,"Wow, this is it, I'm gonna meet my dad. This is like the biggest thing ever, huh."
7711,Sure is.
7712,"OK, here I go. I'm goin' in."
7714,Good luck Phoebs.
7715,"OK, here I go. . . here I go. . . I'm goin'. "
7716,"Hi, welcome to our tropical Christmas party. You can put your coats and sweaters and pants and shirts in the bedroom."
7717,"It's hard to tell because I'm sweating, but I use exactly what the gel bottle says, an amount about the size of a pea. How, how can that be too much?"
7718,"Ice, ice, ice squares anyone? Take a napkin. Alright."
7719,"Monica, Monica, your guest are turning into jerky, OK."
7720,"Really? I'm perfectly comfortable.  Hey, hey, hey, get in line buddy, I was next. "
7721,Mr. Treeger.
7722,"Uhh, you said there was a party."
7723,"Oh, yeah, well hey, welcome to our sauna."
7724,"Ahh, is it hot? My body always stays cool, probably 'cause I have so much skin. Hey, cheese!"
7725,"Alright, alright, here's the chance. Monica give him cash, Rachel give him your earrings. Something, now, anything."
7726,"No, I will not cave."
7727,"Yeah, I'm with Mon."
7728,"Alright, alright, you know how you say I never seize the day? Well, alright, even though he's your super, I'm seizing.  Mr. Treeger, here is 50 bucks, merry Christmas."
7729,"Oh wow, I didn't get you anything. Here's five back."
7730,"No no, no, that, that's your Christmas tip, alright. Oh, hey, do you think there's a chance you could fix that radiator now?"
7731,"No can do, like I told the girl, I can't get a new knob until Thursday."
7734,Looks like he's playin' baseball.
7735,You mean hardball?
7736,Whatever.
7737,What'cha gonna' do?
7738,"Excuse me, I'm seizing. Mr. Treeger, here's another 50, happy Hanukkah. Will uh, will this help with the knob getting?"
7739,"No, the place is not open 'till Tuesday. Am I not saying it right."
7740,"So, wait, you really did like my cookies?"
7741,"Oh, yeah, they were so personal, really showed you cared."
7742,Nice seizing. . . gel boy.
7743,"So, uh, is this, uh, mistletoe?"
7744,"Huh-huh, no act--no, uhh, that, that is basil."
7745,"Ahh, if it was mistletoe, I was gonna kiss ya."
7746,"Huh-hoo, yeah, no, it's still basil."
7748,How far'd ya get?
7749,Mailbox.
7750,"Alright, we're gettin' closer."
7752,"Phoebs, what's goin' on?"
7753,"No, it's just like, ya know, it's a whole mess of stuff, ya know. It's like, yesterday, ya know, my dad was this, like, famous Burma tree surgeon guy and, ya know, now he's a, a pharmacist guy and. . ."
7754,"Well, maybe he's, maybe he's this really cool pharmacist guy."
7755,"Yeah, maybe, yeah. You know, and, and I'll knock on the door and, and he'll hug me and I'll have a dad. Ya know and I'll, I'll go to his pharmacy and everyone will be really nice to me 'cause, you know, I'm Franks daughter."
7756,"Well, so why not go knock?"
7757,"Well, 'cause, I mean, what if, what if he's not this great dad guy? I mean, what if, what if he's just still the dirtbag who ran out on my mom and us? You know what? I've already lost a fake dad this week and I don't think I'm ready to lose a real one."
7758,"Phoebs, that's OK. You took a big step today."
7760,"Yeah, and someday when you're ready, you'll make it past the hedges."
7761,"Yeah, and when you do, he'll be lucky to have you."
7762,You guys. I'm sorry about your shopping.
7763,"Oh, that's OK, we'll figure something out."
7764,"Uh, listen Phoebs, I know you're not goin' in there but do you think it'd be alright if I went in and used his bathroom? Oh, that's fine, never mind. Cool, snow, kinda like a blank canvas."
7765,"Ho, ho, ho, holy crap is it hot in here!"
7766,"Really, hey, you mind if I turn the heat down?"
7767,"Hey, we could have used that kind of thinkin' earlier."
7768,"Hey, Phoebs, how'd it go."
7769,"Oh, I couldn't go in."
7771,Are you OK?
7772,"Yeah, yeah, no it's OK 'cause, I mean, I know he's there, so, that's enough for now."
7773,"Hey, guys, it's after midnight, merry Christmas everyone. "
7774,"Hey, Monica, the knob was broken so I just turned it off from underneath, I hope that's alright."
7775,"Rach, these are for you."
7776,Wiper blades. I don't even have a car.
7777,"No, but with this new car smell, you'll think you do."
7778,"OK, Phoebs, your turn."
7779,"Ahh, toilet seat covers! Is that what you were doing while I was getting gas?"
7781,You guuuyys.
7782,"And for Ross, Mr. Sweet-tooth."
7783,You got me a cola drink?
7784,"And, a lemon lime."
7785,"Well this, this is too much, I feel like I should get you another sweater."
7786,And last but not least.
7787,They're ribbed for your pleasure.
7788,"Joey, would you slow down? They're not gonna be sold out of papers at one o'clock in the morning."
7789,I'm excited! I've never gotten reviewed before.
7790,"You were so amazing as the king. I was really impressed, I was."
7791,"Although, you know what? You might want to consider wearing underwear next time. Yeah, cause when you sat down on your throne you could kind of see your... royal subject."
7792,"Here it is, here it is.  The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction was Joseph Tribbiani's disturbingly unskilled portrayal of the king."
7793,"OK, look, that is one guy's opinion, alright. Phoebs, read yours."
7794,"OK.  The only thing worse than the mindless, adolescent direction..."
7795,"Does anyone have one from a different paper? Ross, read yours."
7796,I don't want to.
7797,"Joey, honey, they don't know what they're talking about."
7799,Maybe they do. I've been doin' this ten years and I haven't gotten anywhere. There's gotta be a reason.
7800,"Oh c'mon. Maybe you're just, uhhh... paying your dues."
7801,"No, no, no, it.. it's too hard. It's not worth it. I quit."
7802,"Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait one minute. Wait a minute. I believe this will change your mind.  In a mediocre play, Joseph Tribbiana was able to achieve brilliant new levels of... continued on page 153... sucking."
7803,"When I was little, I wanted to be a veteranarian, but then I found out you had to put your hands into cows and stuff."
7804,Hiiiiii.
7805,Are... are you OK?
7806,"Yeah, yeah, just a tough day at work. A stegosaurus fell over and trapped a kid. Whoa, whoa, I know this jacket, this is, th--Fun Bobby's jacket! Where is he, what. He, he's here, isn't he?"
7808,Don't toy with me.
7809,Geller!
7810,"Hey, Fun Bobby!"
7811,"Hey. Whoa, hey, you've been working out, huh?"
7812,"Not at all! I love this guy. Hey, I was so psyched to hear you're back with my sister!"
7813,You and me both.
7814,"Hey, so what'd I miss, what'd I miss, c'mon?"
7815,"Oh, we were just trying to make Joey feel better."
7816,"Hey, do you need me to pick you up?"
7817,"No, I'm alright man. Really."
7818,"No, I'm picking you up."
7819,"Hey no, seriously, I don't need you to pick me...  Alright! It still works."
7820,"OK, now before I go, does anybody else need to be picked up?  I'm still gonna go."
7821,"OK, I'll see you later babe."
7822,"Uh, public display of affection coming up. You can avert your eyes. "
7823,See ya. 
7824,Bye! See you later!
7825,Fun Bobby is so great.
7826,"Oh, isn't he? Oh, you know, I really think this time it may work with him. I mean, he just makes me feel so good and I've been feeling so lousy this last couple of months, no job, no boyfriend. Well, at least my cup is half full."
7827,Half full of looooovvvvve.
7828,"And for our two-week anniversary, he's gonna take me to his cousin's cabin for the weekend."
7829,Cabin of loooooovvvvve.
7830,"We went through a lot of wine tonight, you guys. "
7831,Really? I only had two glasses.
7832,I just had a glass.
7833,Two.
7834,I had one glass.
7835,I had about a mugful in this lovely 'I got boned at the Museum of Natural History' mug.
7836,"OK, so that's... that's what, two bottles? And yet somehow we went through five?"
7837,Oooooh.
7838,Ooooooh.
7839,So what. So he drank a lot tonight.
7840,"Yeah but, you know, now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen Fun Bobby without a... a drink in his hand."
7841,"Yeah. Oh, OOOH, yeah, you know, did you notice how he always starts his stories with, um, OK, 'I was soooo wasted,' or, 'Oh, we were soooo b*mb,' or, ummm, ooh, ooh, 'So I wake up, and I'm in this dumpster in Connecticut.'"
7842,"Monica, have you ever been with him when he wasn't drinking?"
7843,"Well, we just happen to go to alot of places where you might drink. I mean, how do you go to a wine tasting without having a drink? Or... or to a club, or to the... zoo."
7844,"Rach, does this have nonfat milk?"
7845,"Ehhhummmm, I don't know, why don't you taste it."
7846,"Mmmm, no."
7847,"Oh well, too late, sorry, you already had some."
7848,"Whattaya say we make these, uh, coffees Irish?"
7849,"Um, cake."
7850,"Yeah, we're gonna... we're gonna get some cake. "
7851,You know what? It seems like you've been making an awful lot of stuff Irish lately.
7852,"Well, I would make them Belgian, but the waffles are hard to get into that flask."
7853,Bobby.
7855,"Look, maybe this is none of my business, or maybe it is, I don't know... but, uh, I'm kind of worried about you."
7856,"OK, look, this isn't the first time somebody's said something to me about this, but, I don't know... I always made excuses about it, like... uhhh... 'I'm just a social drinker,' or, 'C'mon, it's Flag Day.'"
7857,"So, what are you saying now?"
7858,"I guess I'm saying, I'll try and quit. I kinda like that you worry about me. "
7859,"Sooo, what's goin' on, huh?"
7860,I am gonna try and quit drinking.
7861,"Ooohh, why?"
7866,Guess who's back in show business.
7867,"Ohh, ohh, Lorne Green?"
7868,"No, no, Phoebs. You know why? Cause he's dead."
7870,"OK, I guess this is gonna seem kinda bittersweet now, but... Joey, that's who."
7871,"Yeah, my agent just called me with an audition for Days of Our Lives!"
7872,"Oh, well, we have to celebrate. You know what we should do? We should do, like, a soap opera theme."
7873,"Hey, yeah... we could all sleep together and then one of us could get amnesia."
7874,"Hey Rach, what time do you get off? We're all gonna do something tonight."
7875,"Ummmm.... well, actually I'm already done, but I...I kinda got plans."
7876,You have other friends?
7877,"Yeah... I, uhh... I have a... I have a date."
7879,With a man?
7880,What? What is so strange about me having a date?
7881,"What about Ross? I mean, are you still mad at him cause he made that list about you?"
7882,"Noooo, no, I'm not mad at him. I'm.. I'm not really anything at him anymore."
7884,"I don't know. Whatever I was feeling, I'm... not."
7885,But you guys came so close.
7886,"Oh, I know, I'm sorry you guys. You're just gonna have to get used to the fact that I will not be dating Ross."
7887,"Here he is. Hi. Guys, this is Russ."
7888,Hhhhiiiii.
7889,"Stop saying you're not talented, you're very talented. It's just with the bird dead and all, there's very little act left. Oh, honey, give me a break, will ya?  Oooh, ooh, I'll talk to you later."
7890,"Well, there's my favorite client. So tell me darling, how was the audition?"
7891,"Well, I think it went pretty well. I.. I got a callback for Thursday."
7892,"Joey, have you ever seen me ecstatic?"
7894,"Well, here it is. "
7895,"OK, uh.... listen, there's something I want to talk to you about. The network casting lady..."
7896,"Oh, isn't Lori a doll?"
7897,"Oh yeah, yeah, she's great, but... I kinda got the feeling that she was sort of... coming on to me. And I definitely would get the part if I would've... you know... if I would have sent the Little General in."
7898,"Oh, I see. Well, I'm just gonna put in a call here and we'll find out what's goin' on and straighten it out.  Yeah, hi, Lori please.  Hi darling. So how 'bout Joey Tribbiani for the part of the cab driver, isn't he terrific?  Uh-huuuuh.  Uh-huuuuh. OK, doll. Talk to you later.   Yeah, you're gonna have to sleep with her."
7900,It's Fun Bobby.
7901,"What, isn't he sober?"
7902,"Oh, he's sober alright. Just turns out that Fun Bobby was fun for a reason."
7903,"Ohhh, OK."
7904,"Alright, here you go, sweetie. "
7905,Thanks. You wanna hear something funny?
7906,"Oh God, yes!"
7907,There are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village.
7908,That is funny.
7909,"I needed to buy a hammer the other night, and I'm out walkin' around the neighborhood but apparently there are no hardware stores open past midnight in the Village."
7910,"Ahhh, hey honey? Don't you have to be at your interview now?"
7911,Oh yeah. See you guys. 
7912,Bye..... ridiculously dull Bobby.
7913,Oh.... my... God.
7914,It's not that bad.
7915,Not that bad? Did you hear the hammer story?
7916,"OK, OK, don't get all squinky."
7917,Maybe it was just the kind of story where you have to be there.
7918,"But I'm gonna be there... for the rest of my life. I mean, I can't break up with him. I'm the one who made him quit drinking. He's dull because of me."
7919,"Alright, don't say that. He's probably always been dull. You just, you know, set it free."
7921,Hey Ross.... bahhhh!
7922,"Hi Russ, I've just got two more tables to clean and then we'll go, OK?"
7923,"OK, I'll just sit here and... uh... chat with your, uh.... friend-type....people."
7924,"Rachel? Um, hi."
7926,"OK, so, you know what you're doing, right?"
7927,Uhh.... waitressing?
7928,"Well, yeah, but... no. I mean, umm... doesn't.... doesn't Russ just remind you of someone?"
7929,"Huh, Bob Saget?"
7930,"Oh, yeah! No, no, no, no, oh, oh."
7931,"Oh, my, oh!"
7932,What? What's wrong?
7933,"I, OK...."
7934,"She's just upset because she, uh, she buttered a spider into her toast this morning."
7936,"Listen, Phoebs, this is gonna be OK.  Ross, Russ. Russ, Ross."
7939,"Are you a, uh, friend of Rachel's?"
7940,"Yes, yes I am. Are you a, uh, a friend of Rachel's?"
7941,"Actually, I'm a... kind of a.... you know, a... date-type... thing... of Rachel's."
7942,A date.
7943,"Yeah, I'm her date."
7944,"Oh, oh, you're... uh... you're, oh you're the date."
7945,"You know, this is actually good, because if we ever lose Ross, we have a spare."
7946,"Oh, you are the, uh... paleontologist."
7947,"Yes, yes I am. And you are a...."
7948,Periodontist.
7949,See? They're as different as night and... later that night.
7950,"Well, I am going to, uh... get a beverage. It was nice, nice... uh... meeting you."
7951,Ditto.
7952,"I, uh, well... I... I met Russ."
7954,"Hey, I didn't know we were, uh, seeing other people."
7955,"Well, we're not seeing each other, so...."
7956,"Well, uh, for your information, there's a woman at the museum, who's curator of moths and other... uh... winged things... who's, uh, let it be known that she is drawn to me much like a... well, you know. But so far I've been keeping her at bay, but, uh, if this is the deal..."
7957,"Well, yeah, this is the deal."
7958,"OK, well, um, have a nice evening."
7959,"Um, Russ, you ready?"
7964,She's dating. She's dating.
7965,"Yes, yes, but did you see who she was dating?"
7967,Do you not see it?
7968,"See what? I don't know what she sees in... innn that goober. And it takes him, what? Like... like... I don't know, uhh... uhhh, hello.... a... week, to get out a sentence."
7969,"Yeah, it's annoying, isn't it?"
7970,....................Yeah.
7973,"Whoa, whoa, so I'm guessing you didn't get the part, or... uh, Italy called and said it was hungry."
7974,"Well, the part's mine if I want it."
7976,"Yeah, if I'm willing to sleep with the casting lady."
7977,Oh my... God?
7978,"Ten years I've been waiting for a break like this Chandler, ten years! I mean, Days of Our Lives. That's actually on television."
7979,"So, what're you gonna do?"
7980,"Well, I guess I could sleep with her... I mean, how could I do that?"
7981,"Well, I... I've got a pop-up book that told me everything I need to know."
7982,I've never slept with someone for a part.
7983,Well is she... 
7985,It's alright. Is she good-looking?
7986,"Yeah, she's totally good looking. I mean, if I met her in a bar, or something, I'd be buying her breakfast.  You know, after having slept with her."
7987,"Y'know, maybe this isn't such a big deal. Y'know, I mean, the way that I see it is you get a great job and you get to have sex. Y'know, I mean, throw in a tree and a fat guy and you've got Christmas."
7988,"I just... I just don't think that I want it that way though, y'know? I mean, let's say I do make it, alright? I'm always gonna look back and wonder if it was because of my talent or because of.. y'know, the Little General."
7989,Didn't you used to call it the Little Major?
7990,"Yeah, but after Denise DeMarco, I had to promote it."
7991,Can I get you something from the bar?
7992,"Yes, I would like something.  No, no thank you."
7993,"If... if you want to drink, it's OK with me, I've got to get used to it."
7994,"No, no really. I.. I wouldn't feel right about it.  Just some water."
7995,So the light went out in my refrigerator...
7996,I'd like a scotch on the rocks with a twist.
7997,"Hey, we're having some fun now, huh, Ross? Wanna do another one, huh Russ? OK... eleven letters, atomic element number 101... ends in ium."
7998,Dysprosium.
7999,Dysprosium? Try mendelevium.
8000,"And weenie number two has it. Unless, of course, nine-down, Knights in White Satin was sung by the Doody Blues."
8001,You don't see it? You actually don't see it?
8003,"OK honey, you're dating Ross."
8004,"No, Phoebs. I'm dating Russ."
8005,Russ is Ross. Russ... Ross!
8006,Steve... sleeve!
8007,"OK, noone is named Sleeve."
8008,"Phoebe, what the hell are you talking about? Other than their names being similar, I'm sorry, I do not see what you're seeing."
8009,"For your information, it's a card sharp, not a card shark."
8010,You could not be more wrong. You could try... but you would not be successful.
8011,"OK, I'm gonna get some more coffee before the pinching and eye-poking begins."
8012,I know what your problem is.
8013,"Oh you do, do you?"
8014,"Um-hum, you're jealous."
8015,Of... of what?
8016,You're jealous because I'm a real doctor.
8017,"Hey, you're a doctor of gums. That's the smallest body part you can major in. It's like day one, floss. Day two, here's your diploma."
8018,"Hey, you listen."
8019,"No, no, let me finish."
8020,"No, let me finish."
8021,"No, you let me fini..."
8024,"Ewww, ewww, ewww, ewww! "
8025,Did Joey say what he was gonna go when he left?
8026,"No, I don't even think he knew. Hey, would you sleep with somebody to get a great job?"
8027,I don't know. Who would I have to sleep with?
8028,Me.
8029,Why would I have to sleep with you?
8030,It's my game. You want the job or not?
8033,Where ya goin'?
8034,"Bobby and I are going away for the weekend, remember?"
8035,Ooooohhhh.
8036,What's with all the bottles of liquor?
8037,"What's going on, is... uh, Bobby drinking again?"
8038,"Oh no no, this is not for him, this is for me. That way he's still sober but I find his stories about shoelaces much more amusing."
8039,"Oh God, even his knock is boring."
8040,Hi. I'll be ready in just a second.
8041,"Uh, can I talk to you a minute?"
8043,This is really hard for me to say.
8044,"Oh God, you fell off the wagon."
8045,"Oh, no, no, it's about you."
8046,What about me?
8047,I think you may have a drinking problem.
8048,"What these?  Oh, these are, um, for.. cuts and scrapes."
8049,"Look, I am just not strong enough to be in a codependent relationship right now, OK?"
8050,Oh... sh**t.
8051,"Well, anyway, I hope we can be friends."
8053,Take care.
8054,You too.
8056,Well we... we kinda broke up.
8057,Awwwwwwww.
8058,Does anybody want these?
8059,I'll take one. Sometimes I like to hold stuff like this and pretend I'm a giant.
8062,How'd the callback go?
8063,It was unbelievable! I walked in there and she was all over me.
8064,So what'd you do?
8065,"Well, I couldn't do it. I told her I didn't want to get the part that way."
8067,"But wait, wait, wait. Then, after I left her office, she caught up with me at the elevator and offered me an even bigger part."
8068,So... and?
8069,"Soooooo... you are now looking at Dr. Drake Ramore, neurosurgeon, recurring in at least four episodes!"
8070,Allright!
8071,Alright... I've got to go shower. 
8073,"Oh, hey."
8075,"I guess you guys heard, Rachel dumped me."
8076,"Yeah, I'm sorry man."
8077,"Oh, all she said was that I remind her too much of somebody. You have any idea who she's talking about?"
8078,"Oh I do, it's.... it's Bob Saget. She hates him."
8082,"Hey, Julie! Hey, how are you doing?"
8083,"Um, oh, I don't know. I mean, it's definitely weird not being with Ross, but I guess I'm doing OK. Actually I've got some of his stuff that he, um...."
8084,"Ok. Here's his diaper bag, and his uh, Mr. Winky, and uh...oh, him. Hi!"
8085,So how did everything go?
8086,"Oh, great. Great. There was a projectile, uh, throwing up incident, but he started it."
8087,"Well, we've gotta go."
8089,"Oh, right. Um, I've got some news. It's about us."
8090,"Oh, you and me?"
8091,"Uh, no, Susan and me."
8092,The other us.
8094,"We're uh, we're getting married."
8095,"As in, ""I now pronounce you wife and wife"" married?"
8096,"Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to."
8097,Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.
8098,Look I just thought that...
8099,"No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!"
8100,Is your finger caught in that chair?
8102,Want us to go?
8104,This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.
8105,"It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives.."
8106,"Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast."
8108,"They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?"
8109,Would it matter?
8110,"Oh, you are so great!  Thank you!"
8111,Are you really not going?
8112,"I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?"
8113,"They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them."
8114,If you wanna call that a reason.
8115,"Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor."
8116,"Ross, I thought you were over this."
8117,"Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there."
8118,"Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever."
8119,Did I miss it? Did I miss it?
8120,"No, I'm on right after this guy sh**t himself."
8121,"Whoa, she's pretty."
8122,"Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting."
8123,"I'm sorry, what?"
8125,"It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this."
8126,"Oh, ok."
8127,"There's my scene, there's my scene.  ""Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon."
8128,Is she gonna be all right?
8129,I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.
8130,Nice!
8132,Excellent!
8133,For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.
8134,That is so good! Do it again!
8135,"All right, all right. ""Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!"""
8136,"That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect."
8137,"No no, that's me."
8139,"Oh, hello."
8140,"Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh..."
8141,Is everything ok?
8142,"Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients d*ed on the massage table today."
8144,That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.
8145,"Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman."
8146,"Oh, honey."
8147,"Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, ""ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage."" Little did she know God was thinking, ""Ok, but that's it."" Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she d*ed, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far."
8149,I think it went into me.
8150,"God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck."
8151,"Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks."
8152,"Ok, who ordered what?"
8153,"Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim."
8154,"Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?"
8155,Oh god.
8156,I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.
8157,"I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?"
8158,Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.
8159,"Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?"
8160,"I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business.  Sit up!"
8161,There she is.
8162,Mom!
8163,"Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun."
8164,Pretty much.
8165,"Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten."
8166,"This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross."
8167,"Oh hello, Ross."
8168,"Hi, Mrs. Green. "
8169,"So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?"
8170,Oh Mom!
8171,"If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink."
8172,"Believe me, sometimes that happens."
8173,"This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you."
8176,"I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales."
8177,"Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?"
8178,I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?
8179,"Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello."
8180,"Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument."
8181,"You have some life here, sweetie."
8182,"I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?"
8183,"I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want."
8184,For...me.
8185,"Well, not just for you."
8186,"Well, what do you mean?"
8187,"I'm uh, considering leaving your father."
8188,"All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts."
8189,Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.
8190,Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.
8191,And you had no idea they weren't getting along?
8193,They didn't fight a lot?
8194,"No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?"
8195,"In my day, divorce was not an option."
8196,"Hey, look who's up."
8197,"I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this."
8198,"Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you."
8199,"Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?"
8200,"You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true."
8201,That's him.
8202,Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.
8204,"Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me."
8205,"Oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting."
8206,"Um, do you wanna sit?"
8207,"Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear?"
8208,"I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me."
8209,"You're saying, my wife is in you?"
8210,"Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?"
8211,"Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that she always used to say that before she d*ed, she wanted to see everything."
8212,Everything?
8213,Everything.
8214,"Whoa, that's a lot of stuff."
8215,"Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time."
8216,"I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head."
8217,"Worth a sh*t, huh?"
8218,Look at this.
8219,These are from Halloween three years ago.
8220,"Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?"
8221,"No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist."
8222,"Um, you guys, you know when I said before, ""thank you, but I don't really need your help""?"
8223,"Actually, what I think you said was, ""don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen."""
8224,"Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it."
8225,"Hey, Mon, you want some help?"
8226,If you want.
8227,"Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty."
8228,She's still with you?
8229,"Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again.  Oh, such a pretty face."
8230,"This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?"
8231,God!
8232,"All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food."
8233,"That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex?"
8234,Oh! What's new in sex?
8235,The only man I've ever been with is your father.
8236,"I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything."
8237,"I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more."
8238,"Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this b*mb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?"
8240,You want me to talk you out of it?
8242,Then what? What do you want?
8243,I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this.
8244,Why on earth would I understand this?
8245,You didn't marry your Barry. I did.
8247,"All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!"
8248,"Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles."
8249,"Joey, speed it up!"
8250,"I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!"
8251,"Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out."
8252,Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?
8253,Sir! No sir!
8254,"All right, you!"
8255,"No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing."
8256,"All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called ""pigs in Ross"". All right, ball the melon."
8257,"Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon."
8260,It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.
8261,"Fine, whatever."
8263,"Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding."
8265,"You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish."
8266,"Carol, what's the matter? What happened?"
8267,My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.
8269,"I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything."
8270,It's ok. I'm sorry.
8271,"And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do."
8272,"I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right."
8274,"Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this."
8275,Of course I do.
8276,"Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it."
8277,You're right. Of course you're right.
8278,So we're back on?
8279,We're back on.
8280,"You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes."
8281,"It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly."
8282,"Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding."
8283,"Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later."
8285,Any time. 
8286,Ross. 
8287,"You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony."
8288,"Oh my god. Now I've seen everything!  Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go."
8289,Would you look at them?
8290,"Yeah, can't help but."
8291,How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you?  I wrapped those bad boys.
8292,I miss Rose.
8293,"Oh, yeah?"
8294,"I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone."
8295,"You know, I uh, I couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life...how 'bout we go get you a drink?"
8296,"Ok, that's so nice."
8297,"I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right? "
8298,"Hey, Mom? Having fun?"
8299,"Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options."
8300,"There's more alcohol, right?"
8301,How you doin'?
8303,You did a good thing today.
8305,You wanna dance?
8306,"No, that's fine."
8307,Come on. I'll let you lead.
8309,All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people. 
8310,"Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?"
8311,"Well, Mon, I was married."
8312,"Yeah, me, too, technically."
8313,I had a wedding.
8314,"All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion."
8315,I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married? 
8316,Isn't Ben in this?
8317,"Oh, yeah!"
8318,Can't get the monkey off your back? Then put it in your mouth...
8319,"...With MonkeyShine Beer.  MonkeyShine Beer, 'cause it's a jungle out there.]"
8320,That commercial always makes me so sad.
8321,"Yeah, but then the guy opens his beer and those girls run at him, so, everything seems to work out OK."
8322,I meant because the monkey in it reminds me of Marcel.
8323,"I can see that, 'cause they both have those big brown eyes and, ya know, the little pouty chin."
8324,And the fact that they're both monkeys.
8325,"Sometimes I wonder if I did the right thing, ya know, giving him away."
8326,"Oh, Ross, you had to, I mean, he was humping everything in sight. I mean, I have a Malibu Barbi that will no longer be wearing white to her wedding."
8327,"Remember when sometimes he'd borrow your hat, and, and when you got it back there'd be little monkey raisins in it."
8328,"Yeah, well sure, when he did it, it was funny. When I did it to my boss's hat. . . all of the sudden I have this big attitude problem."
8329,"Hey, hey, check it out, guess what I got."
8330,Rhythm?
8331,"No, my first fan mail."
8333,"'Dear Dr. Remore, know that I love you and would do anything to have you.' Gosh. 'Your not-so-secretive admirer, Erica Ford.' Ooh wait, 'PS enclosed please find 14 of my eyelashes.'"
8334,"Ya know, in crazy world, that means you're married."
8335,"This wasn't addressed to Days of Our Lives, this is, this came to your apartment. There's no stamp on it, this woman was in our building."
8336,"Oh my god, I got my very own stalker."
8339,"Ooh, where are you off to, Travelin' Jake?"
8340,"Well, there's this, uh, paleontology conference in L.A. so I figured I'd go and then drive down to the zoo and surprise Marcel."
8341,"You know I think he will be surprised, 'till he realizes he's a monkey, and uh, you know, isn't capable of that emotion."
8342,"Oh, Phoebe, that really cute guy is here again."
8343,"Oh, oh, OK, so everyone, pretend like I'm telling you a story, OK. And, and it's really funny. So everyone just laugh, now."
8344,"I know, I know.  Hello."
8345,Hi. I'm Rob Dohnen.
8346,Hi Rob Dohnen.
8347,"I don't know anything about music, but I think you're really, really great."
8348,"Oh, wow."
8349,"Anyway, I schedule performers for the childrens libraries around the city and I was just thinking, have you ever thought about playing your songs for kids?"
8350,"Oh, I would love to have kids. . . you're, you're the, you're, me play the songs that I will write for them."
8351,"Hey, whaddya wanna do for dinner?"
8352,Well we could just stay in and cook for ourselves. 
8354,It's Erica.
8355,"Ah, the stalker."
8356,"Never mind, it's open."
8357,"Yes, hitting her with a frying pan's a good idea. We might wanna have a backup plan, though, just in case she isn't a cartoon."
8358,Let's get out of here.
8359,The one time they're not home.
8360,"OK, we'll just leave, and when we pass her on the stairs, she won't know it's me 'cause we've never met."
8361,That's how radio stars escape stalkers.
8362,She's comin'.
8363,It's me.
8364,"Uhh, this is it, this is how we're gonna die. Ready?"
8365,"Wait, wait, wait. "
8367,Erica.
8368,"Hi, Dean Lipson, zoo administrator. I was told you had a question."
8369,"Well, I uh, I can't seem to find the monkey I donated last year. He's a capuchan, answers to the name Marcel."
8370,"Ahh, I'm afraid I have some bad news. Marcel has passed on."
8371,"Oh my God, what happened?"
8372,"Well he got sick, and then he got sicker, and then he got a little better but then he d*ed."
8373,I can't believe this.
8374,"I'm sorry Mr. Geller. But ya know, there's an old saying, 'Sometimes monkeys die.' It's not a great saying but it certainly is fitting today."
8375,"Well, ya know, someone should have called me."
8376,"I'm sorry. Look, I know this can't bring him back but here, it's just a gesture."
8377,Zoo dollars?
8378,"Yes, and come see the bird show at 4. The macaws wear hats. Well it's a lot cuter if your monkey hasn't just d*ed."
8379,Ooohhh.
8381,"I can't believe Joey's having lunch with his stalker. What i-, what is she like."
8382,"Well, you remember Cathy Bates in Misery?"
8384,"Well, she looks the exact opposite of that."
8385,And she's not crazy?
8386,"Oh no no no, she's a total wack job. Yeah, she thinks that Joey is actually Dr. Drake Remore."
8388,"Ah, and I mean, he's going out with her? He can not persue this."
8389,"Hey, just because this woman thinks she can actually see Joey through the magical box in her living room doesn't mean she's not a person. I mean, does she not deserve happiness, does she not deserve love? What're you lookin' at me for? He's the one who wants to boff the maniac."
8390,You OK?
8391,"No, uh-uh, I'm just, I'm nervous. So, you know what, maybe if I just, if I picture them all in their underwear."
8392,"That's not a good idea, that's kinda the reason the last guy got fired."
8393,"I'm just, I'm, I'm, I'm used to playing for grown-ups. Ya know, they just, grown-ups drink their coffee and do their grown-up thing, ya know, and kids listen. This is a huge responsibility. What? Are you gonna kiss me?"
8394,I was thinkin' about it.
8395,"OK.  OK, alrighty, let's play some tunes. Hi everybody, I'm Phoebe"
8396,Hi Phoebe.
8397,"OK, um, I'm gonna play, um, some songs about grandparents, OK. "
8398,"Oh, Drake, isn't it amazing?"
8399,Yeah it is. . . what?
8400,"Well, here we sit, devil may care, just a little while ago you were reattaching someone's spinal cord."
8401,"Yeah, that was a tricky one. In reality, that operation takes like, over 10 hours, but they only showed it for 2 minites."
8402,Who's they?
8403,No one.
8404,"Oh Drake, you are so talented, let me see those hands. Oh these hands, these beautiful hands, oh I could just eat them. . . but I won't."
8405,"Good, otherwise my watch would fall off. "
8406,"No, seriously. These hands. These miracle, magical, life-giving hands. Oh, just to be near them, touch them, maybe even lick one?"
8407,"Alright, just one.  Wow, you're good at that."
8408,"Oh my God! Someone, he's choking. Is anyone here a doctor?"
8409,"Well, yes, yes, the best doctor in all of Salem, Dr. Drake Remore."
8410,Meet me in the nocturnal house in 15 minutes.
8411,"Uhh, hey look, I don't really enjoy being with other men that way. But, um, zoo dollars?"
8412,It's about your monkey. It's alive.
8413,"I don't understand, why didn't you help that man?"
8414,"Uhh, cause, uhh, I'm a neurosurgeon and that was clearly a case of, uh, uh, foodal chokage. Alright, look, I got to tell you something."
8415,"No, no no no, you don't have to tell me anything. You don't have to explain yourself to me. Ooh, who am I to question the great Dr. Drake Remore?"
8416,But that's what...
8417,I should just be happy to be near you.
8418,Hey I- 
8419,Hey what?
8420,"That's it, just hey. Like at the end of a dance, HEY!  Hey. He-hey."
8421,There'll be times when you get older
8423,Very informative!
8424,Not at all inappropriate!
8425,Thank you for coming everybody. There're cookies in the back.
8426,"That was great, the kids loved you."
8427,"Yay, I rock."
8428,"And you know why? Because you told the truth, and nobody ever tells kids the truth.You were incredible."
8429,But.
8430,How did you know there was a but?
8431,I sense these things. It was either but or butter.
8432,"The thing is, I think some of the parents, they were kinda hopin' that you'd play more songs about like, barnyard animals."
8433,I can do that.
8436,Because that would be fantastic. What? You wanna kiss me?
8437,Thinkin' about it.
8438,"Ahh, the bat. Ambassador of darkness, flitting out of his cave like a winged messenger, sightless spectre of the macabe."
8439,"Buddy, my monkey?"
8440,"Oh, yeah, right. There was a break-in, few months back, inside job. Your monkey was taken."
8441,Oh my God. But the zoo told me that my monkey was dead.
8442,The zoo! Do you believe everything the zoo tells ya?
8443,"That, that's the only thing the zoo's ever told me."
8444,Of course they're gonna say he's dead. They don't want the bad publicity. It's all a great big cover-up. Do you have any idea how high up this thing goes?
8445,That guy Lipson?
8446,Lipson knows. Do you have any idea who else knows?
8447,"No, I, I only know Lipson."
8448,"Hmm, Lipson knows huh? Ahh, hello Mr. Opossum, enigma of the trees, upside-down denizen of the night, taunting gravity with..."
8449,"Buddy, my monkey, my monkey."
8450,"Word on the street - well, when I say street, I mean those little pretend streets they have here at the zoo."
8452,"Your monkey found a new career, in the entertainment field. That's all I know."
8453,This is unbelievable.
8454,"So, what is this information worth to you, my friend?"
8455,Are you trying to get me to bribe you?
8457,But you already told me everything.
8458,"Check it out, he actually is the MonkeyShine monkey."
8459,"Well, so what're you gonna do?"
8460,"Well, I guess I'm gonna call the beer company and try to find out where he is."
8461,That's what I did when I lost my Clydesdales.
8462,"OK, hi again."
8464,Today we're gonna start with some songs about barnyard animals.
8465,You're the only one who can save her Drake.
8466,"Damnit, I'm a doctor, I'm not God."
8467,"Well, there goes my whole belief system."
8469,"Oh my God, quick turn off the TV."
8470,"No no no, wait, I wanna see what happens."
8471,"Uh, I get Leslie out of the coma and then we make out."
8472,"Well how can that be, you were just kissing Sabrina?"
8473,"Rachel, it's a world where Joey is a neuro-surgeon."
8474,"Hey Erica, c'mon in."
8475,"How did you get here so fast, I just saw you in Salem?"
8476,"Right, they uh, they choppered me in. What's up?"
8477,"Ohh, and I see you're having a little party too. Is she here, huh, huh?"
8479,Sabrina. I know about you two. I saw you today kissing in the doctor's lounge.
8480,"It's not what you think, that was..."
8481,You told me I was the only one. 
8482,"Alright look, that's it. I don't think we should see each other anymore, alright. Look, I know I should have told you this a long time ago but I am not Drake Remore, OK. I'm not even a doctor, I'm an actor. I just pretend to be a doctor."
8483,Oh my God. Do the people at the hospital know about this?
8484,Somebody wanna help me out here?
8485,"Oh, I know, I know. "
8486,"How, how can you be here and there."
8487,'Cause it's a television show.
8488,"Drake, what're you getting at?"
8489,I'm not Drake.
8490,"That's right, he's not Drake, he's Hans Remore, Drake's evil twin."
8491,Is this true?
8492,"Yes, yes it is true. And I know this because, because he pretended to be Drake to, to sleep with me. "
8493,"And then he told me he would run away with me, and he didn't. "
8494,"And you left the toilet seat up, you bastard. "
8495,Is all this true?
8496,"Yes, I'm afraid it is. You deserve much better than me Erica. You deserve to be with the real Drake, he's the one you fell in love with. Go to Salem, find him, he's the guy for you."
8497,Oh Hans. 
8498,Hans...Hans...Yo evil twin.
8499,"Right. Goodbye Erica, good luck in Salem. Take care"
8500,I'll never forget you Hans. 
8501,"OK, alright, the people who threw the water."
8502,Fired! Why?
8503,The library board has had a lot of complaints from parents about some of the stuff in your songs.
8504,I can't believe it. Did you tell your board about how kids want to hear the truth?
8506,I see.
8507,Maybe if you just played some regular kiddie songs.
8508,"No. What do you, what do you want me to be, like some stupid, big, like, purple dinosaur?"
8509,I'm not saying you have to be Barney.
8510,Who's Barney.
8511,"Well, I tracked down Marcel and get this, he's healthy, he's happy, and he's right here in New York filming Outbreak II - The Virus Takes Manhattan."
8513,This is amazing.
8515,I finally get a part on TV and the monkey's makin' movies.
8516,"OK, Rachel, I'm ready."
8518,Excuse me. Is this where the singing lady is that tells the truth?
8519,"Um, yeah I guess that's me."
8520,She's here.
8521,"Sometimes men love women,"
8522,"This is so exciting, I haven't seen my monkey in almost a year."
8523,"What, you never look down in the shower? Oh please. I'm not allowed to make one joke in the monkey-is-penis genre?"
8524,"C'mon people, back up please, back up, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon."
8525,"Uh, excuse me, uh, where can we find the monkey?"
8526,"I'm sorry guys, closed set."
8527,"Uh, I'm sorry, you don't understand, I'm, I'm, I'm a friend of his. We uh, we used to live together."
8528,"Yeah, and I have a time share in the Pocanos with Flipper."
8529,"Ross, there he is."
8530,"Hey, hey buddy, Marcel. Marcel.  In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight.  In the jungle, the mighty jungle the lion sleeps tonight.  a-weema-way, a-weema-way..... "
8531,"Uh, excuse me folks this is a uhh..."
8532,Closed set. We know but we're friends with the monkey. 
8533,"Good morning. Hey pal, look who I brought. It's your old friend Harry Elefante. "
8534,"Woah, dude, burn."
8535,"I don't get it, he seemed so happy to see me yesterday."
8536,"Hey don't take it personal, he's under a lot of pressure, ya know, starring in a movie and all."
8537,Now just how big of a star is Marcel?
8538,"In human terms, I'd say Cybill Shepard."
8540,"So, are you guys in the movie, or are you just really paranoid."
8541,"Hey Sal, Jerry wants to know if the monkey's ready for the subway set?"
8542,"Uh, excuse me. Jerry is the director, which one's he?"
8543,The one in the director's chair.
8544,"Gotcha. Phoebs, walk with me."
8545,"OK. Um, how come I'm walking with you?"
8546,"Well, we're, we're just goin' over here so that we can get away from the horrible flesh eating virus, for the love of God woman, listen to me. Is he lookin', is he lookin'?"
8547,We've got a problem.
8548,Tell me.
8549,I can't do Chris's makeup. She refuses to acknowledge that she has a moustasche.
8550,Is it bad?
8551,"It looks like one of her eyebrows fell down. Now unless someone convinces her to let me bleach it, Jean-Claude Van Damme is gonna be making out with Gabe Kaplan."
8552,I'll talk to her.
8553,I hate actors.
8554,"Nice camoflauge man, for a minute there I almost didn't see ya."
8555,Excuse me.
8557,"Uh, is your name Chandler?"
8558,"Uh, yes, yes it is."
8559,Chandler Bing?
8560,Do you know me or are you just really good at this game?
8561,"I'm Susie Moss. Fourth grade, glasses, I used to carry around a box of animal crackers like a purse. "
8562,"Susie Moss, right, yeah, wow, you look. . . great job growing up."
8563,It's nice to see you're not still wearing that denim cap with all the little mirrors on it.
8564,"Oh, right, well yeah, I graduated fourth grade and realized I wasn't a pimp."
8565,"Remember the class play? You, you pulled up my skirt and the entire auditorium saw my underpants."
8566,"Yes, back then I, uh, used humor as a defense mechanism. Thank God I don't do that anymore."
8567,"Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God."
8568,What what what what?
8569,"Jean-Claude Van Damme. I didn't know he was in this movie, he is so hot."
8570,Ya think?
8571,"The muscles from Brussels, wham bam Van Damme, did you see Time Cop?"
8572,"No, was he any good in it?"
8573,"Rachel, he like, totally changed time."
8574,"Wow, so why don't you go talk to him?"
8576,"What, so you go over there, you tell him you think he's cute, what's the worst that could happen?"
8577,He could hear me.
8578,"OK, I'm doin' it for ya."
8579,"Oh Rachel don't, don't you dare, don't, don't. Tell him I cook."
8580,Excuse me. Hi.
8582,"Um, this is gonna sound kinda goofy but uhhm, my friend over there, who cooks by the way, um, she thinks you're cute."
8583,You don't think I'm cute?
8584,"I, I don't know, um, do you think you're cute? OK, we're kinda gettin' off the track here. Um, I was supposed to come here and tell you my friend thinks you're cute. So what should I tell her?"
8585,You can tell her I think her friend is cute.
8586,"No, Stephen Hurs was the kid who would eat anything for money, David Stein was the guy who had no elbows."
8587,"OK, well then who was the kid that got caught masturbating?"
8588,"OK that's not what he was doing. Alright, he was looking for his bus money."
8589,"Oh that's me, I gotta go."
8590,"Oh uh, o, OK."
8591,"Um, so listen, how many times am I gonna have to touch you on the arm before you ask me on a date."
8592,"Well, uh, let's try one more. . . there you go, say Ernie's, 8 o'clock."
8593,"I'll be there, and who knows, if things go well, maybe this time I'll get to see your underwear."
8594,No one was around to hear that?
8595,So what'd he say?
8596,"Agh, what a jerk. I kept talking about you and he kept asking me out. I mean, naturally, you know, I said no."
8597,"Well, thanks anyway."
8598,"He just kept asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking, and asking."
8599,"Rachel if you, if you want to go out with him, you can. Sound like a big jerk to me but if that's what you want to do..."
8600,"Jean-Claude she said yes, I'll see you tonight. Thank you."
8601,And then Jean-Claude took me to that place Crossroads and that's where we hung out with Drew Barrymore.
8602,"Oh man, she's so smokin, she has got the greatest set of. . . no guys around, huh."
8603,Does anybody need anything?
8604,"Oh, I'll have an espresso. Oh acutally, I'll get it. If I ask you to, you'll probably end up drinking it yourself."
8605,That is so unfair.
8606,"I know. Oh, like you would drink her coffee after what you did to her with Van Damme."
8607,"Hey Joey I have to cancel racketball for tonight, that was Marcel's trainer. He's gonna let me have him for a couple of hours."
8608,You're blowin' me off for a monkey?
8609,"Hey, we can rescedule for Saturday."
8610,"Yeah, unless you hook up with a bunch of pigeons."
8611,"Hey, stick a fork in me, I am done."
8612,Stick a fork what?
8613,"Like, when you're cooking a steak."
8614,"Oh, OK, I don't eat meat."
8615,"Well then, how do you know when vegetables are done?"
8616,"Well you know, you juist, you eat them and you can tell."
8617,"OK, then, eat me, I'm done."
8618,"I've met the perfect woman. OK, we're sitting on her couch, we're fooling around, and then suddenly she turns to me and says, 'Do you ever want to do it in an elevator?'"
8619,What did you say?
8620,"Ahh, I believe my exact words were, 'Flaign,en - sten'. I mean I didn't know what to say, how do you know if you wanna do it on an elevator?"
8621,"Oh, you just know."
8622,"Oh, sh**t, we gotta go, got a reservation in 30 minutes."
8623,"Oh no no no no, no no no no no no, you see, what I had planned shouldn't take more that 2, 3 minutes tops."
8624,"Oh, 200 seconds of passion. We gotta go."
8625,"But um, here's an idea, have you ever worn women's underwear?"
8626,"Well, ye, yes, actually, but, uh, they were my Aunt Edna's, and there were three of us in there."
8627,"Well I was thinking it would be um, kind of sexy if you wore mine tonight, at dinner."
8628,You want me to wear your panties?
8629,Could ya?
8630,"Well, if I was wearing your underwear then, uh, what would you be wearing?. . . You're swell."
8631,"OK, got the music, got the dinner. Oh and check it out, I made Marcel's favorite dish, banannacake."
8632,Oooh.
8633,With mealworms.
8634,"Yaaahhh. Ahhh, candles. What'dya thinks gonna happen here tonight?"
8635,"Hello. Oh hi, are you on your way ove-. Oh. No, no, I, I understand, I mean a monkey's gotta work. No it, it's no big deal, it' not like I uh, had anything special planned. Yeah OK, OK. OK, OK, bye."
8636,"OK, Rachel, why don't you start talking first."
8637,"Alright, I feel that this is totally unjustified.  She gave me the green light, I did nothing but-. Do you think I can't see you in the TV set?"
8638,"Alright Monica, if there is something that you would like to share..."
8639,"Ya know, you had no right to go out with him."
8640,That is the most ridiculous.
8641,You sold me out.
8642,I did not sell you out.
8643,Yes you did. Absolutely.
8644,Would you let me talk. 
8645,Did you just flick me?
8646,"OK, well, you wouldn't let me finish and I was jus-  Ow. That hurt "
8647,Quit flicking 
8648,"Ow, you stop flicking."
8649,You flicked me first.
8650,"OK, now I'm gonna kick some ass."
8651,Ow. Ow. Ow.
8652,"Alright, now I will let go if you both stop."
8653,"Oh, what do you, you want me to stop seeing him, is that what you want?"
8655,You want me to just call him up and tell him that you're seeing him instead? That's what you want?
8657,Oh that's what you want.
8660,"Fine,"
8661,"There we go.You know what, if we were in prison, you guys would be, like, my b*tches."
8662,Thanks for letting me tag along tonight you guys.
8663,Forget about it.
8664,How you doin there squirmy?
8665,I'm hangin in. . . and a little out.
8666,"So, assistant to the director. That's a really exciting job, I mean, you must have a ton of cool responsibilities."
8667,I have nothing to do with casting.
8668,So what're you guys gonna eat?
8669,How come all I can think about is putting that ice in my mouth and licking you all over?
8670,Because I went to an all boys high school and God is making up for it.
8671,"I want you right here, right now."
8672,"Right now, right here. Don't ya think we're in kind of a public plaaaa  They do have the shrimp."
8673,Meet me in the bathroom. 
8674,I'm going to the bathroom now. 
8675,C'mon.
8676,I can't believe we're doing this.
8677,"Alright mister, let's see those panties."
8678,Alrighty. 
8679,Ooh. Ooh. But ya know what would be even sexier?
8681,If you didn't have your shirt tucked into them.
8683,Alright. Now I would like to see you wearing nothing but them. Take your clothes off.
8684,"OK, but uh, I hope you realize this means we're gonna miss hearing about the specials."
8685,"C'mon hurry, hurry."
8686,"Hey, do you want this done quick, or do you want this done right?"
8687,"Alright, turn around. Time to see you from behind."
8689,"Oh, somebody's been doing his buns of steel video."
8690,"Well, you want me to uh, clench anything, or-... Susie? Susie."
8691,This is for the fourth grade.
8692,"Huh? Where, whaddya mean?"
8693,"Whaddo I mean. Whaddya mean, whaddo I mean? I mean underpants, mister, that's what I mean."
8694,"What, what's what you mean?"
8695,"My skirt, you lifted, kids laughing. I was Susie Underpants 'till I was 18."
8696,That was in the fourth grade. How could you still be upset about that?
8697,"Well um, why don't you call me in 20 years and tell me if you're still upset about this. "
8698,"Alright, I hope you realize you're not getting these underpants back."
8699,"I can't believe this, just like 2 weeks ago I was watching Sudden Death, now I'm on a date with Jean-Claude Van Damme. Can you b*at up that guy?  Can you b*at up that guy?"
8701,"This is so wild. Ya know, I gotta admit, I was kinda surprised that you agreed to go on a blind date."
8702,"Normally, I would not do it."
8703,"Well, what made you make the exception for me?"
8704,"'Cause Rachel told me uh, you were dying to have a threesome with me and uh, Drew Barrymore. By the way, Drew has some groundrules and..."
8705,Say you're sorry.
8707,Say it.
8709,"Rachel, you say you're sorry or your sweater gets it."
8710,"OK, OK, that is my favorite sweater, that is my third date sweater."
8712,"OK, you wanna play? OK, let's play, let's play. "
8714,You give me back my sweater or it's handbag marinara.
8715,You don't have the guts.
8716,"Oh yeah. Well, at least I wasn't too chicken to tell some guy I thought he was cute."
8717,"Oh alright, stop, STOP THE MADNESS. This is crazy. Who can even remember why this even started in the first place?"
8718,"Yes that's right. But still, I-, look at your purse, look at your sweater, look at yourselves."
8719,I'll help you fix your sweater.
8720,I'll help you throw out your purse.
8721,I'm sorry that I made you stop seeing him.
8722,"Well, I'm sorry I went out with him when I knew you liked him."
8723,I'm sorry that I borrowed your gloves 
8724,Joey?
8725,Ma?
8727,"Chandler? What're you still doin' here, I though you guys took off."
8728,"Oh, no no no, she took off with my clothes."
8729,Are you naked in there?
8730,Not exactly. . . I'm wearin panties.
8731,"Huh, you uh, you always wear panties?"
8732,"No, no, this is the first time."
8733,"Wow, talk about your bad luck, I mean, the first time you try panties and someone walks off with your clothes."
8734,"I was not trying them out, Susie asked me to wear them."
8735,"Well, let me see."
8736,"No. I'm not letting you or anybody else see, ever."
8737,"Alright, alright.  Woah, someone's flossing."
8738,"Joey, some people don't like that."
8739,Chandler's wearing panties.
8740,What? Let me see. 
8741,"No, no, you don't have to see."
8742,Hi Tushie.
8743,"Alright, one of you give me your underpants."
8744,"Can't help you, I'm not wearing any."
8745,How can you not be wearing any underwear?
8746,"Oh, I'm gettin' heat from the guy in the hot pink thong."
8747,Alright look Ross I'll give you 50 dollars for your underpants.
8749,"Hey Phoebs, can I have the milk after you?"
8750,"I'm almost done with it, keep your panties on."
8751,"Hey, hey, and I'm in the movie."
8753,"One of the virus victims called in sick, so Cathy recommended me and boom, I'm dying on the gurney. Oh Ross, Marcel just finished his last scene if you want to go down there and say goodbye."
8754,"Ahh, oh that's OK, I mean, he's probably got, you know, parties to go to and stuff. But, ya know, he's moved on. Hey, that, that's the way it goes right."
8757,"I'm sorry it didn't work out between you and me,  or you and me. Drew was very disappointed."
8758,"OK, well, bye. "
8759,Goodbye.
8760,"Well, bye for me too. "
8761,"OK, well, bye-bye again. "
8763,"Perhaps, uh, the three of us, just could. . ."
8764,"Oh, no no no no no."
8765,"Are you sure, I can crush a walnut with my butt."
8766,No no no no.
8767,Impressive.
8768,But no. Maybe if I were baking.
8769,Bye-bye.
8770,"Bye Marcel. See ya on the big screen. You keep people drinkin' that beer, OK. I miss you buddy."
8771,"You know, I think I want to write a song about all this."
8772,Oh yeah.
8773,"Yeah. Oh, except one of the strings on my guitar is broken. Hey, Chandler, can I borrow your G-string?"
8774,How long you been waitin' to say that?

8800,To my best bud.  Thanks best bud.
8801,Put it on.
8802,"Oh, now?  No, no, I think something this nice should be saved for a special occasion. "
8803,"Oh, no no, that's the beauty part, it goes with everything.  You put this on, you're good to go.  Ohhh man, you are so wearin' that bracelet."
8804,I so am.
8805,You have any idea what this'll do for your sex life?
8806,"Well, it'll probably slow it down at first but, once I get used to the extra weight, I'll be back on track."
8807,"Well, this all looks good."
8809,And if I want to call for a reference on your last job?
8810,"Oh, that's there on the bottom, see the manager, Chandler Bing."
8811,"Alright, lets see if you're as good in person as you are on paper. Make me a salad."
8812,"A salad? Really I, I could do something a little more complicated if you like."
8813,"No, just a salad will be fine."
8815,"Now, I want you to tell me what you're doing while you're doing it."
8816,"Alright, well I'm tearing the lettuce."

I mean this, this Casey should be takin' down my messages, ya know, or, or, Rachel and I should be together and, and we should get some kind of me, message service."
8836,"Hang in there, it's gonna happen."
8837,"Wha, OK, now how do you know that?"
8838,Because she's your lobster.
8839,"Oh, she's goin' somewhere."
8840,"C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life. You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their t*nk, ya know, holding claws like. . ."
8841,"Hey, you feelin' better?"
8842,"Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me."
8843,"So, do you have any other possibilities?"
8844,"Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent."
8845,"Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money."
8846,"No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you."
8847,"Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them."
8848,"Ya know, the man's got a point. "
8849,What is that sparkly thing?
8850,"That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy."
8851,"No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella."
8852,"Man, man that is sharp. It must have cost you quite a few debloons."
8855,Hi darling.
8856,"So, what's this."
8857,Some of your old stuff.
8858,"Well sweetie, we have a surprise for you. We're turning your room into a gym."
8859,"Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?"
8860,"Gosh, we talked about that but your brother has so many science trophies and plaques and merit badges, well we didn't want to disturb them."
8861,"Oh, God forbid."
8862,"Oh, hi Rachel."
8864,"Oh, we were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up, dear."
8865,"Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see."
8866,"Well, I can't say any of us were surprised. Your parents have been unhappy ever since we've known them. Especially after that incident in Hawaii."
8867,"What, what incident?"
8868,"Uhh, naa, no no no, I, I must be thinking of someone else, uh, maybe me. Don't you have some folding to do? Go fold dear. Fold. You fold. "

8875,"I, I really have to be somewhere but it was nice meeting you."
8876,"What?  Oh this is excellent. You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap."
8878,"Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. "
8879,"Chandler, Chandler."
8880,"I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . .  Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau.  That's actually good."
8881,"Would you look at that guy, I mean how long has he been talking to her. It's like, back off buddy she's a waitress not a geisha."
8882,I think she's OK.
8883,"Look at that, look at that, see how she's pushing him away and he won't budge. Alright, I'm gonna do something.  Excuse me, are you Rachel?"
8885,"I'm Ross Geller. Wha, I'm, God in your add you said you were pretty but wow."
8886,"What are you, what are you doin'?"
8887,"Oh, oh my God, is this the wrong day? I don't believe it, uh, well, hey, I guess if it works out we'll, we'll have something to tell the grandkids."
8888,"Sure will. I've uh, gotta go. Take care."
8889,"OK, see ya later, nice meeting you.  You're welcome."
8891,I was saving you.
8892,"Saving, saving, saving me from the pleasant conversation with the interesting man, saving me?"
8893,"Oh, see from where I was sitting I uh. . ."
8894,"OK, Ross, listen to me, I am not yours to save."
8895,"But, you are."
8897,"Uh, uh, well you're, umm, you're my lobster."
8898,"OK, you know what, are, are you being like, the blind date guy again?"
8899,"No no, you're uh, you're my lobster. See um, lobsters, uhh, in the t*nk when, when they're old, uhh, they get with, uhh, they walk around holding the claws. In the t*nk, ya know, with, with the holding and. . . Uhh, Phoebs you wanna help me out with the, the whole lobster thing?"
8900,Do the claws again.
8901,"Rach. OK, forget, forget the lobsters OK. We're, let's talk, what about us?"
8902,"Ross, there is no us, OK."
8903,"No, but. . ."
8904,"No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not worth it."
8905,"Well, but, but. . ."
8906,"NO but Ross. We are never gonna happen, OK. Accept that."
8907,"E-except, except that what?"
8908,"No, no, ACC-cept that."
8910,"Hey man, look it's my best bud. How ya doin?  Wow, you are really gettin' good at that Marcel Marceau thing. Hey, whaddya say uh, we play some ball, you and me, huh, whaddya say?  OK, that's my bad."
8911,"If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so."
8912,"Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?"
8913,"Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?"
8914,"OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that.  Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . .  wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there. "
8915,You know what the. . . 
8916,"I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . . "
8917,"You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush. I'm just saying, it's right there."
8919,"Hi, darling. Where's my grandson, you didn't bring him?"
8920,"No, he's at uh, Carol's and Susan's today."
8921,A woman in my office is a lesiban. I'm just saying.
8922,"Oh, Jack look, there's that house paint commercial that cracks you up. "
8924,"Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet?"
8925,"No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet."
8926,"C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news."
8927,"Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it."
8929,Because they made me.
8930,You were fired? What're you gonna do?
8931,"Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica we're talking about. We taught her well. Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go?"
8932,In the bank.
8933,"There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for. She's gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it. "
8934,Anything larger back there?
8935,I can't believe it.
8936,Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.
8937,"Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay. "
8938,Hey. I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what g*n found? 
8939,"Hey now you have two.  Oh, now you have two."
8940,"What am I gonna do, huh? "
8943,How come you have two?
8944,Well this one's for you.
8946,"No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry,  it's about you and me and the fact that we're  best buds."
8947,"Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies."
8948,That's what they'll call us.
8949,"Here you go, you can pay me back whenever you like."
8950,You have dinosaur checks?
8951,"Yeah, yeah I mean, you get your money and you learn a little something, what's wrong with that?"
8952,"Nothin', nothin', hey you're a cheapasaurus. I'm kidding, I'm kidding, thank you, I'm very greatful."
8953,"Hey, Mon, what is this?"
8954,"Oh, um, that was my bathing suit from high school. I was uh, a little bigger then."
8955,"Oh, I thought that's what they used to cover Connecticut when it rained."
8956,"Hey Monica, what's on this video tape?"
8957,"Hey, you got me, put it in."
8961,"Over here Jack. OK. I see, Rachel's coming up the path. Oh doesn't she look pretty. Jack, get this. "
8963,What is with your nose?
8964,"They had to reduce it because of, of my deviated septum."
8965,"OK, I was wrong, that's what they used to cover Connecticut."
8966,"You know what this is, this is us getting ready for the prom."
8968,"You know what, you guys, we don't have to watch this."
8969,Oh yeah we do. C'mon.

8975,"Ahh, so how many cameras are actually on you?"
8976,"Oh, you look so great."
8977,"Ahh, so do you, beautiful. "
8978,Oops.
8980,"sh**t, I think I got mayonaise on you."
8981,"Oh, that's OK, it's just the shoulder, it's not my dress."
8982,Everybody smile.
8983,"Oh, dad, turn it off."
8984,It is off.
8985,"Dad, it is not. What's with the red light?"
8986,It's the off light. Right Ross? 
8987,Lookin' good Mr. Cotter.

8989,"Oh, thanks. So, uh, what are you gonna do this summer?"
8990,"Oh, you know, I'm just gonna, I'm gonna hang out, work on my music."

8999,"He'll be here OK, take a chill pill. "
9000,I just told Rachel that Roy touched my boob.
9001,"I can't go to my own prom without a date, I can't, it's too late."
9002,If you're not going then I don't want to go either.
9003,"Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass."
9004,I have a wonderful idea. You should take Rachel to the prom.
9005,Doubtful.
9006,"Jack, give me that. Talk to your son."
9007,"Your mother's right. Take her, you can wear my tux."
9008,"Dad, she won't want to go with me."
9009,"Of course she would, you're a college man."
9011,"Well, c'mon. Don't ya want to find out?"
9012,"I can't believe I don't get to go to my own prom, this is so harsh."
9013,OK. Hold my board.

9083,"Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. See Phoebe, Phoebe."
9084,"Really Phoebs? Because, you know, you'd have to be an actual waitress. This can't be like your 'I can be a bear cub' thing."

9093,"I've been great, just great. How have you been? "
9094,"Oh, well obviously you know Barbara and I split up, otherwise you wouldn't have done the head tilt."
9095,The head tilt?
9096,"Yeah, since the divorce, when anybody asks me how I am, it's always with a sympathetic head tilt.  'How ya doin'? You OK?'"
9098,"No no, it, it's fine, believe me. I do it too. I always answer with the 'I'm OK' head bob.  'I'm OK.'  'You sure?'  'Yeah, I'm fine.' Hey listen, I've got to set up the music. I got a new CD changer, of course the divorce only left me with 4 CD's to change."
9099,"Oh, that's too bad."
9100,I'll survive.
9101,"Uh, two larges, extra cheese on both. But listen, don't ring the buzzer for 19, ring 20, Geller-Green, they'll let you in, OK. If you buzz our door, there's no tip for you. OK, thanks. Pizza's on the way. I told you we wouldn't have to get up."
9102,What if we have to pee?
9103,I'll cancel the sodas.
9104,"You've got to get back out there, it's your party."
9105,"But they're so dull, they're all opthamologists."
9106,You're an opthamologist.
9107,"Only because my parents wanted me to be, I wanted to be a sherrif."
9108,"That's funny, no. Cadillac, cataract, I get it, no I get it, you stay out there."
9109,See.
9110,"Alright, I'll tell you what. I'll come get you in 5 minutes with some sort of um, kabob emergency."
9111,"OK. You better. Oh God, here we go. Hey wanna see 'em go nuts? Watch this.  Who needs glasses? "
9112,You are so smitten.
9113,I am not.
9114,"Oh, you are so much the smitten kitten. You should ask him out."
9115,"Dr. Burke? I don't think so. I mean, like, he's a grown up."
9116,So. You two are totally into each other.
9117,"Phoebe, he's a friend of my parents. He's like 20 years older than me."
9118,"OK, so what, you're just never gonna see him again?"
9119,"Not never. I mean, I'm gonna see him tomorrow at my eye appointment."
9120,"Didn't you like, just get your eyes checked?"
9121,"Well yeah, but, you know, uh, 27 is a dangerous eye age."
9122,"C'mon, I'm not saying it was a bad movie, I'm just saying, you know, it was a little. . . hard to follow."
9123,I told you there was going to be sub-titles.
9124,"I know, I just didn't want to wear my glasses on my first date."
9126,It would really help when I'm kissing you if you didn't shout out my sister's name.
9127,"Honey, I'm just checking."
9130,Mon.
9133,"What, what."
9134,"I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry, it's just that when you moved your hands down to my butt, it was like woah, Ross's hands are on my butt. Sorry."
9135,"And that's, that's funny why?"
9136,"Well it's not, honey I'm sorry, I guess I'm just nervous. I mean, it's you, ya know, it's us. I mean, we're crossing that line, sort of a big thing."
9137,"I, I know it's big, I just didn't know it was uh, ha-ha big."
9139,"OK, my hands were no where near your butt."
9140,"I know, I know, I know, I know. I was just thinking about when they were there the last time, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. OK, OK, look, woah, I promise, I'm good, I'm not gonna laugh anymore. OK put your hands back there."
9141,"No see now, now I can't because uh, I'm feeling too self conscious."
9142,Just one cheek.
9143,"Nuh, uh, the moment's gone."
9144,"Alright, just put your hands out and I'll back up into them."
9145,That's romantic.
9146,C'mon touch it.
9148,"Oh, come on squeeze it."
9150,Rub it.
9152,"Oh, come on, would you just grab my ass."
9153,"Wow, look at that. The car is on fire, yet somehow it's expensive paint job is protected by the Miracle Wax."

9160,"Oh. Listen, have you ever been uh, you know, foolin' around with a girl and uh, she started laughin'?"
9161,"Yeah, but uh, it was 1982 and my flock of seagulls haircut was tickling her chin."
9162,She laughed at you?
9163,"Yeah. I don't know, I've been wanting this since like ninth grade typing, ya know. And I just want it to be perfect and right and. . . why isn't that laser beam cutting through the paint?"
9164,It's the Miracle Wax.
9165,It certainly is a miracle.
9169,"Hi. Listen, I was um, thinkin' about. . ."
9170,"Listen can you guys uh, speak up, it's harder for us to hear you when you lower your voice."
9171,"OK, listen, I'm sorry about last night and I really want to make it up to you."
9172,"No, you, ya know there's no need to make it u. . . how?"
9173,"Well, I was thinking maybe a um, a romantic dinner with um, candles and wine and then uh, maybe going back to my place for um, dessert."
9174,"Humm, that sounds, I don't, perfect."
9175,What's this.
9176,Could you get us a couple of beers?

9220,"It's the museum again, can I, oh."
9221,"Ya know, Dr. Burke kissed me once."
9223,"When I was um, 7, I crashed my bike right out in front of his house and to stop me from crying he kissed me right here. "
9224,Oh you are so lucky.
9226,"Woah, woah, woah australopithicus isn't supposed to be in that display. No. No. No, n, h*m*-habilus was erect, australopithicus was never fully erect."
9227,Well maybe he was nervous.
9228,"Oh look, I can't believe this. Look, h*m*-habilus hasn't even learned how to use tools yet and they've got him here wi, with clay pots. Why don't, why don't they just give him a microwave? I'm sorry, I'm sorry this is taking so long, ya know, I, I, it's just it's longer than I expected, we will have dinner."
9229,"It's OK, it's fine."
9230,KARL!
9231,"Wow, is that Michelle?"
9233,"I've not seen her since high school graduation. Oh my God, that night she got so dru. . . motional."
9234,"Ya know, she's having another baby."
9235,I thought she just had one.
9236,"No no. Henry's almost two and he's talking and everyting. Here. You know, the other day he told me he liked me better than his other grandpa. Now in all fairness his other grandpa's a drunk but still. . ."
9237,"Oh, you're a grandpa."
9238,Yeah. Are we nuts here?
9239,"I don't know, maybe. I mean I'm dating a man who's pool I once peed in."
9240,"I didn't need to know that. I guess 21 years is a lot. I mean, hell, I'm a whole person who can drink older than you."
9243,So maybe we should just. . .
9244,"Yeah, yeah, maybe."
9245,"Wow, this really sucks."
9246,"Yeah, it sure does. "
9247,"Well, we don't really have to decide anything right now, do we?"
9248,"No, no, there's no rush or anything."
9249,Pizza delivery.
9250,"Oh, I'm gonna k*ll those guys."
9251,Rach.
9253,I'm done.
9254,"Yeah well, you know what, so is uh, Sorentino's."
9255,"Wha, OK, I'm sorry, let's uh, why don't we find someplace else."
9256,"No, you know what, it's late, everything's gonna be closed. Why don't we just do it another night?"
9257,"No, no, we won't."
9258,We won't?
9260,"OK, that's dead right?"
9261,What is this? What are we doing?
9262,Shh. Do you want cran-apple or cran-grape?
9263,Grape.
9264,"OK, now, sit. OK. "
9265,"Oh, God."
9267,"Ah, so what are we looking at?"
9268,"Well uh, you see that, that little cluster of stars next to the big one? That is Ursa Major."
9270,"I've no idea, could be. Listen, I'm sorry I had to work tonight."
9271,"Oh it's OK. You were worth the wait, and I don't just mean tonight. "
9272,You're not laughing.
9273,This time it's not so funny.
9274,"Ah, oh God. Oh, honey, oh that's OK."
9275,"What. Oh no, you just rolled over the juice box."
9276,"Oh, thank God."
9278,Hi you. I can't believe I'm waking up next to you.
9279,I know it is pretty unbelievaaaaah.
9281,We're not alone. 
9282,Is that the fire alarm?
9283,"Yeah.  Oh it's not warm yet, we still have time."
9285,Man this is weird. You ever realize Captain Crunch's eyebrows are actually on his hat?
9286,"That's what's weird? Joey, the man's been captain of a cereal for the last 40 years."
9287,Waaa-aaah.
9289,The spoon. You licked and-and you put. You licked and you put.
9290,"Yeah, so."
9291,Well don't you see how gross that is? I mean that's like you using my toothbrush.  You used my toothbrush?
9292,"Well, that was only 'cause I used the red one to unclog the drain."
9293,"Mine is the red one! Oh God. Can open, worms everywhere."
9294,"Hey, why can't we use the same toothbrush, but we can use the same soap?"
9295,Because soap is soap. It's self-cleaning.
9296,"Alright, well next time you take a shower, think about the last thing I wash and the first thing you wash."
9300,"Ooh, look at you fancy lads. What's the occasion?"
9301,"Well, you know that guy that's on my show that's in a coma? He's havin' a brunch."
9302,Ahh.
9303,"OK, ready when you are."
9304,Okey-doke.
9305,I can't believe you guys are actually getting tattoos.
9306,"Excuse me, you guys are getting tattoos?"
9307,"Yes, but you can not tell Ross 'cause I want to surprise him."
9308,"Wow, this is wild. What're you gonna get?"
9309,"Um, I'm getting a lily for my Mom. 'Cause her name's Lily."
9310,"Wow, that's lucky. What if her name was Big Ugly Splotch?"
9311,So where you gettin' it?
9312,I think on my shoulder. 
9313,What? What's on your shoulder?
9314,"Um, a chip. A tattoo, I'm getting a tattoo."
9315,"A tattoo? Why, why would you want to do that?  Hi."
9316,"Hi. Well hey, you don't - you don't think they're kind of cool?"
9317,"No, sorry I don't. Tell me why would anyone pay someone to scar their body for life? What if it doesn't come out right Phoebe? Then it's like, I don't know, havin' a bad hair cut all the time. Why's everyone staring at me?"
9318,"Ross, come sign this birthday card for dad. Rich is gonna be here any minute."
9319,"Oooh, Rich is goin' to the party too, huh?"
9320,"Well, he's my parents' best friend, he has to be there."
9321,"Oh, is today the day you're gonna tell them about you two?"
9322,"Yeah. It's my dad's birthday, I decided to give him a stroke."
9323,"No, I think you should tell them."
9324,"No, I don't even know how serious he is about me. Until I do, I'm not telling them anything."
9325,"I don't know, I don't think mom and dad would mind. Remember when you were 9 and Richard was 30, how dad used to say, 'God I hope they get together.'"
9326,"Alright, shall we?"
9327,"OK, wait, wait, wait, wait. You know what? Ross, let's - let's switch places. You get in the middle. No un-, ya know, unless this looks like we're trying to cover something up."
9328,"Monica, Monica, you could come in straddling him, they still wouldn't believe it.  We're here."
9329,Oh hi kids. Hi darling.
9330,Happy birthday dad.
9331,Oh thank you.
9332,Hi ma.
9334,"Well, you kids thank Dr. Burke for the ride?"
9335,"Uh, actually mom, I think Monica thanked him for the both of us."
9336,"Well, you kids take the train in?"
9337,"No, Richard Burke gave them a ride."
9338,"Oh. Speaking of whom, I hear he's got some 20-year-old twinkie in the city. "
9339,"Finger cramp. Oh God, sorry. Here, let me get that mom."
9340,"Sooo, Richard's shopping in the junior section."
9341,Are we still on that?
9342,We just know she's got the IQ of a napkin.
9343,"She's probably not even very pretty, just young enough so that everything is still pointing up. "
9344,Can you believe this place?
9345,"I know, this is a great apartment."
9346,"Ah, I was just in the bathroom, and there's mirrors on both sides of you. So when you're in there it's like you're peein' with the Rockettes."
9347,"Wow, there's my fantasy come true. No, seriously."
9349,"Hey! We were just sayin', great apartment man."
9350,Thanks. You want it?
9352,"Yeah, I'm movin' to a bigger place. You should definitely take this one."
9353,"Yeah, can you see me in a place like this?"
9354,Why not? You hate park views and high ceilings? C'mon I'll show you the kitchen.
9355,"Oh that's all right fellas, I saw a kitchen this morning - on TV. Stop talking. OK."
9356,"C'mon, tell us."
9357,"Yeah, is she really 20."
9358,I am not telling you guys anything.
9359,"C'mon Rich, it's my birthday, let me live vicariously."
9360,"Dad, you really don't want to do that."
9361,"Ahh, what's a little mid-life crisis between friends?"
9362,"Jack, would you let it go?"
9363,"Look, I know what you're going through. When I turned 50 I got the Porsche. You... you got your own little speedster."
9364,"Guys. Seriously, it is not like that."
9365,"Tell you what, maybe one of these weekends you can borrow the car and I cou. . ."
9366,"Dad, I beg you not to finish that sentence."
9367,What? I'm kidding. You know I'd never let him touch the Porsche.
9368,"OK Rach, which, which lily? This lily or that lily?"
9369,Well I. . .
9370,"I like this lily. It's more open, ya know, and that's like my mom. She had a more open, giving spirit. Ooh, Foghorn Leghorn, ooh."
9371,"Alright, blonde girl, you're in room two, not so blonde girl, you're with me."
9374,You're not going?
9376,What? Is it - is this 'cause of what Ross said?
9377,"No. Well, yeah, maybe."
9378,"I don't believe this. Is this how this relationship's gonna work? Ross equals boss. I mean, c'mon what is this, 1922?"
9379,What's 1922?
9380,"Just, you know, long time ago. Well, when men used to tell women what to do - a lot. And then there was suffrage, which is a good thing but is sounds horrible. Do you want to get this tattoo?"
9381,"Yes I do, it's just that Ross is. . ."
9382,"OK, hey, HEY. Is your boyfriend the boss of you?"
9384,"OK, who is the boss of you?!!"
9385,You?
9386,No. You are the boss of you. Now you march your heinie in there and get that heart tattooed on your hip. GO!!
9387,How ya doin'?
9388,I'm a twinkie.
9389,Really? I'm a hero.
9390,"Oh, this is so hard."
9391,"Yeah, I know. I hate it too. Look, maybe we should just tell them."
9392,Maybe we should just tell your parents first.
9393,My parents are dead.
9394,"God, you are so lucky. I mean, I mean. . . you know what I mean."
9395,"I know, I know. Just hang in there, OK. OK, I'll go out first, alright."
9397,"Judy, going to the bathroom, good for you."
9398,"Thank you Richard, I appreciate the support."
9399,"Honey. Honey, have you seen my Harmon Kilerbrew bat? Bob doesn't believe I have one."
9400,I have no idea. Did you know Richard has a twinkie in the city?
9401,I know. He's like a new man. It's like a scene from Cocoon.
9402,I just never would have pictured Richard with a bimbo.
9403,"Apparently, he told Johnny Shapiro that she's quite a girl. In fact, he told Johnny that he thinks he's falling in love with her."
9405,"I tell you, I've never seen him this happy."
9406,"So Jack, you ever think about trading me in for a younger model?"
9407,Of course not. With you it's like I've got two 25-year-olds.
9408,Oh Jack stop.
9409,"C'mon, it's my birthday."
9410,Can we drop this? I am not interested in the guy's apartment.
9411,"Oh please, I saw the way you were checking out his mouldings. You want it."
9412,"Why would I want another apartment, huh? I've already got an apartment that I love."
9413,Well it wouldn't k*ll you to say it once in a while.
9414,"Alright, you want the truth? I'm thinkin' about it."
9416,"I'm sorry. I'm 28 years old, I've never lived alone, and I'm finally at a place where I've got enough money that I don't need a roommate anymore."
9417,"Woah, woah, woah. I don't need a roommate either, OK? I can afford to live here by myself. Ya know, I may have to bring in somebody once a week to lick the silverware."
9418,"What're you gettin' so bent out of shape for, huh? It's not like we agreed to live together forever. We're not Bert and Ernie."
9419,"Look, you know what? If this is the way you feel, then maybe you should take it."
9420,Well that's how I feel.
9421,Well then maybe you should take it.
9422,Well then maybe I will.
9423,Fine with me.
9424,"Great. Then you'll be able to spend more quality time with your real friends, the spoons."
9425,Who's drink can I freshen?
9426,Almost time for cake.
9427,"Mon, Mon, are you OK?"
9428,You remember that video I found of mom and dad?
9430,"Well, I just caught the live show."
9431,Eww.
9432,Hey there.
9434,"Nothing, I just heard something nice about you."
9435,"Humm, really?"
9436,Richard. Richard. Your son isn't seeing anyone is he?
9437,"Uhh, not that I know of."
9438,"Well, I was thinking, why doesn't he give Monica a call?"
9439,That - that's an idea.
9440,"Well, actually, I'm already seeing someone."
9441,Oh?
9444,"She never tells us anything. Ross, did you know Monica's seeing someone?"
9445,"Mom, there are so many people in my life. Some of them are seeing people and some of them aren't. Is that crystal?"
9446,"So, who's the mystery man?"
9447,"Well, uh, he's a doctor."
9448,A real doctor?
9449,"No, a doctor of meat. Of course he's a real doctor. And he's handsome, and he's sweet, and know you'd like him. "
9450,Well that's wonderful. . . I
9451,"Mom, it's OK."
9452,It is Judy.
9453,Jack. Could you come in here for a moment? NOW!
9454,Found it.
9455,I'll take that dad. 
9456,It seems your daughter and Richard are something of an item.
9457,"That's impossible, he's got a twinkie in the city."
9458,"Dad, I'm the twinkie."
9459,You're the twinkie?
9460,She's not a twinkie.
9461,"Al-alright, l-look you guys, this is the best relationship I've been in. . ."
9462,"Oh please, a relationship."
9463,"Yes, a relationship. For your information I am crazy about this man."
9466,Am I supposed to stand here and listen to this on my birthday?
9467,"Dad, dad this is a good thing for me. Ya know, and you even said yourself, you've never seen Richard happier."
9468,When did I say that?
9469,Upstairs in the bathroom right before you felt up mom.
9470,"Oh that looks so good, oh I love it."
9471,"I know, so do I. Oh Phoebe, I'm so glad you made me do this. OK, lemme se yours."
9472,"Ahh. OK, let's see yours again."
9473,"Phoebe we just saw mine, let me see yours."
9474,"Oh OK.  Oh no, oh it's gone, that's so weird, I don't know how-where it went."
9475,You didn't get it?
9477,Why didn't you get it?
9478,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry."
9479,"Phoebe, how would you do this to me? This was all your idea."
9480,"I know, I know, and I was gonna get it but then he came in with this needle and uh, di-, did you know they do this with needles?"
9481,"Really? You don't say, because mine was licked on by kittens."
9484,"Hey listen, I'm sorry about what happened. . ."
9485,Yeah me too.
9486,I know. Yeah.
9487,Yeah. So do we need to hug here or. . .
9488,"No, we're alright."
9489,So I got ya something. 
9490,Plastic spoons. Great.
9491,Lick away my man.
9492,"These'll go great in my new place. You know, 'till I get real ones."
9494,"Well, I can't use these forever. I mean, let's face it, they're no friend to the environment."
9495,"No-no, I mean what, what's this about your new place?"
9496,I'm movin' out like we talked about.
9497,Well I didn't think that was serious.  Ya know I thought that was just a fight.
9498,"Well, it was a fight. . . based on serious stuff, remember. About how I never lived alone or anything. I just think it would be good for me, ya know, help me to grow or. . . whatever."
9500,"Hey, are you cool with this. I mean, I don't want to leave you high and dry."
9501,"Hey, no, I've never been lower or wetter. I'll be fine. I'll just turn your, uh, bedroom into a game room or somethin', you know, put the foosball table in there."
9502,Woah. Why do you get to keep the table?
9503,I did pay for half of it.
9504,"Yeah. And uh, I paid for the other half."
9505,"Alright I'll tell you what, I'll play you for it."
9506,"Alright, you're on. I can take two minutes out of my day to kick your ass."
9507,Your little men are gonna get scored on more times than your sister.
9508,"Woah, woah, woah, woah. Which sister?"
9509,"So, are you sorry that I told them?"
9510,"No, it's been a long time since your dad and I went running."
9512,Oh. Well did you get it? Let me see.
9513,Is Ross here?
9514,No he went out to get pizza.
9515,"Oh really, OK. "
9517,Very tasteful.
9518,"Wanna see mine, wanna see mine?"
9520,What? You didn't get one.
9521,"OK, well then what is this? "
9522,What're we looking at? That blue freckle?
9523,"OK, that's my tattoo."
9524,"That is not a tattoo, that is a nothing. I finally got her back in the chair, bairly touched her with a needle, she jumped up screaming, and that was it."
9525,"OK, hi. For your information this is exactly what I wanted. This is a tattoo of the earth as seen from a great distance. It's the way my mother sees me from heaven."
9526,"Oh, what a load of crap. That is a dot. Your mother is up in heaven going, 'Where the hell is my lily, you wuss?' OK, Phoebe, that is not a tattoo, this is a tattoo. "
9527,You got a tattoo?
9528,Maybe. But just a little one. Phoebe got the whole world.
9529,Lemme see. 
9531,Well it's really. . . sexy. I wouldn't have thought it would be but. . . wow.
9533,"Yeah, so uh, is it sore or can you do stuff?"
9535,"Hey, save us some pizza. "
9536,"Get out of the corner. Pass it, pass it."
9537,Stop talkin' to your men. 
9538,Yes! And the table is mine.
9539,Congratulations. 
9540,"Hey, you guys are still gonna come visit me, right?"
9541,"Oh yeah, you got the big TV. We'll be over there all the time. . .  except when we are here."
9542,I know you're just moving uptown but I'm really gonna miss you.
9543,"I know, how can you not be accross the hall anymore."
9544,"Yeah, who's gonna eat all our food, and tie up our phone lines, and - is that my bra? What the hell you doin' with my bra?"
9545,"Oh no-no, it's uh, it's not what you think. We uh, we used it to, you know, fling water balloons off the roof. Remember that, those junior high kids couldn't even get theirs accross the street."
9546,"Yeah, I remember."
9547,"Hey, let's bring the rest of these down to the truck."
9548,"So, uhh, em, you want me to uh, give you a hand with the foosball table?"
9549,"Naa, you keep it, you need the practice."
9551,"So, I guess this is it."
9552,"Yeah, right, yeah, I guess so."
9553,"Listen, uh, I don't know when I'm gonna see you again."
9554,"Well, I'm guessing uh, tonight at the coffee house."
9555,"Right, yeah. OK. Um, take care."
9557,Huh? So whaddya think? Casa de Joey. Huh? I decorated it myself.
9560,"Wow Joey, this is, uhh..."
9561,Art.
9562,Art it is.
9563,"Look, check this out. Is it a coffee table, is it a panther? There's no need to decide."
9564,"Hey, nice pillow. So now tell me, is this genuine Muppet skin?"
9565,"Hey, excellent, excellent water-table thing. "
9566,"Thanks, yeah. I love this but ya know what, it makes me wanna pee."
9567,"Yeah, well me too, yeah. I think that's the challenge."
9568,"Hey, how come, uhh, Chandler didn't come?"
9569,"Well uh, it's cause he had a thing with, wi-, with the thing."
9570,"Right, I go-, I got it."

9576,"That's right, I have a phone in here."
9577,"Joey, promise me something."
9579,Never call me from that phone.
9580,"OK, here we go. Honey, I'm sorry, they were all out of apple pie, someone just got the last piece."
9581,"Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God. You are not gonna believe this. I have just been discovered."
9582,"Now wait a minute, I claimed you in the name of France four years ago."
9583,"Anyway, OK, now promise you won't like, freak out and say how great this is until I'm done, OK."
9585,"OK. I just met this producer of this like, teeny record company, who said that I have a very fresh, offbeat sound and she wants to do a demo of Smelly Cat."
9586,"I told you not to do that yet. And, she wants to do a video."
9587,"I'm not done yet, OK. God. OK, if that goes well, they may even want to make an album."
9588,I'm done now.
9589,"Oh God. Ross, OK, if you care about me at all, you will get the pie out of the man's hood."
9590,Get the what?
9591,"Pie in the hood, pie in the hood. Go."
9592,What're you doing?
9593,"I'm sorry, my pie was, was in your hood. Now I just have to get the coffee out of that guy's pants and I'll be back in the hospital by 7. "
9594,"Damnit Ross, get your butt out of the bathroom."
9595,"Calm down, I'm blow drying."
9596,"Blow drying what, you have no hair."
9598,"Your boyfriend has been in there for over an hour. I can't believe it, it's like I'm living with him again. He's here when I go to sleep, he's here when I wake up, he's here when I want to use the shower, ughh. It's like I'm sixteen all over again ."
9599,"Well, you're not sixteen, you're both adults now."
9600,GET OUT YOU DUFUS!!
9601,"Or ya know, he's rubber and you're glue."
9602,All yours.

9605,Shut up.
9607,Cut it out.
9608,Mi-mi-mii.
9609,I've never wanted you more.
9610,"So, whaddya say boys, should I call him?  Well, ya know what they say. Ask your slippers a question... you're going crazy."
9614,"Listen, I'm, I'm sorry I didn't make it over there today."
9615,"Oh, that's OK. You uh, you had a thing."
9616,"Yeah well, I hear the place looks great."
9617,"Ahh, forget about it, I'm havin' a ball. How's the apartment doin'"
9618,"Oh hey, it's, it's terriffic. I mean it's a regular space... fest."
9619,"Oh, well great."

9622,That's right my friend. It's time for...
9623,Baywatch!! 
9624,"Oh, can you believe they gave Stephanie skin cancer?"
9625,I still can't believe they promoted her to lieutenant.
9626,"Naa, you're just sayin' that 'cause you're in love with Yasmine Blepe."
9627,"Well, how could anyone not be in love with Yasmine Blepe?"
9628,"Hey, hey, they're runnin'"
9629,"See, this is the brilliance of the show. I say always keep them running. All the time, running. Run. Run Yasmine, run like the wind."
9630,But I thought you wanted to live by yourself.
9631,"I did. I thought it'd be great. I figured I'd have like, time alone with my thoughts but, ya know, it turns out I don't have as many thoughts as you'd think."
9632,"Joey, why don't you talk to Chandler about moving back?"
9633,"You really think he'd take me? I mean, we had a pretty good talk last night but, when I moved out, I hurt him bad."
9634,"I promise you, he would definitely want you back."
9635,"I'm telling you, there's no way he's moving back."
9636,"But we had one of the greatest talks we ever had last night. I mean it was, it was like when we first started living together."
9637,"Look, I know you don't want to hear this right now but, we've seen him in his new place, alright. And he's happy, he's, he's decorated."
9638,"Look, Chandler, he has moved on, OK, you have to too."
9640,"No. You're just gonna have to accept the fact that you're just friends now, OK, you're not... rommmates anymore."
9641,"OK Phoebe, you ready to try one?"
9642,"OK.  Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat  Oh woah, oh my God. I mean like, who was that?"
9643,"OH!! Oh I thought they were just watching me. You know, like at, like at an aquarium, ya know."
9644,Alrighty. From the top.
9645,"OK.  Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Smelly cat  OK, sorry. I'm just, I'm just not getting that everyone um, gets how smelly this cat acually is. I just think that maybe if we could talk about this, 'cause I need to feel that you really care about the cat."
9646,"Honey, uh we, we can talk about this. It's just that it's costing about a hundred dollars a minute to be in here."
9647,"Oh OK. So, um, the cat stinks but you love it, let's go."
9648,"No, there is no way he was a velociraptor. No Tony, look at the cranial ridge, OK. If Dino was a velociraptor, he would have eaten the Flintstones. Yeah, yeah.  Oh, were you takin' a nap?"
9649,I was.
9650,"Oh I-, Oh wait, Tony can you hang on? That's the other line.  Hello. Oh yeah she's here but uh, can she call you back? OK thanks.  Call Joanna.  Hi."
9651,Did she leave a number?
9652,Did you see me write one down?
9653,"I don't have her number, butt-munch."
9654,"Well, she'll call back, don't be such a baby."
9655,"I'm not a baby, you're the baby."
9656,"Look, you wanna get off my back?"
9657,You wanna get out of my face?
9658,"Wait hold on Tony, hold on.  Hello. Hi, yeah no, she's right here. Um hold on.  Hi Tony, can I call you back? That's uh, that's my sister's boyfriend."
9659,Give me that.
9661,"Hi sweetie, look before I forget, did I leave my diaphram at your place? Hi mom. "
9663,"So uhh, how's the palace?"
9664,You know it's funny you should mention that 'cause I was thinkin'... what's with the boxes?
9665,"Oh, uhh, actually I uh, have some news."
9666,"Hey Chan, is that Joey guy gonna come by and pick up his moose hat or should I just toss it out?"
9667,"Well, uh, why don't you ask him yourself. Joey, this is my new roommate Eddie."
9668,Nice to meet ya.
9669,"Likewise. Uh, I'll take that.  It's what I came for. So, this is new. Where'd you two meet?"
9670,"At the uh, supermarket, in the uh, ethnic food section. I helped him pick out a chorizo."
9672,"Well you know, we got to talking and uh, he said he needed a place and I had a spare room."
9673,"Oh, now it's a spare room?"
9674,"Well yeah, in that it's not being used and I... have it to spare."
9675,"Well I uh, got what I came for.  I'll uh, I'll see you guys."
9676,Hey Jo. When'd you start usin' mousse in your hair?
9677,Is this guy great or what?
9678,"Yeah, yeah he is. "
9679,I can't believe he has a new roommate. Who is this guy?
9680,"Uh, Eddie something. He just met him."
9681,"It'll never last, he's just a rebound roommate."
9684,"Oh, check it out, oh check it out. It's Smelly Cat the video."
9685,"Now OK, I haven't seen it yet so, if you don't like it, well, so what, none of you ever made a video.  OK."
9688,"I sound amazing. I, I, I've never heard myself sing before. I mean, except in my own head. Oh, this is so cool, now I can hear what you hear."
9689,"Pretty uhm, different huh?"
9690,"Oh, I am sorry but I am incredibly talented."
9691,"Hi Joey, what's goin' on man?"
9692,Eddie.
9694,"Morning. I just uh, came by to pick up my mail.  Where's the mail?"
9695,"Oh it's uh, over there on the table."
9696,You don't keep it over here on this table any more?
9697,"No, Eddie likes to keep it over there."
9698,"Alright, here you go my friend. Eggs a-la Eddie, huh?"
9699,"Oh, ooh."
9702,"No I just uh, thought you liked your eggs with the bread with the hole in the middle, a-la me."
9703,"Well I do, but uh, Eddie makes them this way and, well they're pretty darn good."
9704,"Well you guys, I'm outta here. See ya pals."
9706,So how you two gettin' along?
9707,"Oh, I couldn't be happier."
9708,"Great, well, I'm happy for ya.  Alright that's it. He just comes in here, Mr. Jonny Neweggs, with his, his, his movin' the mail and his, his 'see ya pals'. And now there's no juice. There's no juice f or the people who need the juice and want the juice. I need the juice."
9709,There's another carton right over there.
9710,"Hey, this isn't about juice anymore, alright man."
9711,"Alright, so what's it about?"
9712,"Eggs. Who's eggs do you like better, his or mine, huh?"
9713,Well I like both eggs equally.
9714,Oh come on. Nobody likes two different kinds of eggs equally. You like one better than the other and I wanna know which.
9715,"Well what's the difference? Your eggs aren't here anymore, are they? You took your eggs and you left. You really expect me to never find new eggs?"
9716,I wanna watch Entertainment Tonight.
9717,"Tough noogies, we're watching Predators of the Serengetti."
9718,Would you guys stop.
9719,It's my TV.
9720,"Wha-, oh, quit it."
9721,Bite me.
9723,"Well, Monica keeps changin' the channel."
9724,"Oh that's great, why don't you tell mommy on me."
9725,"Now I'm mommy in this little play? Alright look, I refuse to get sucked into this like, weird little Geller dimension thing OK. So I'm gonna go and take a nice long hot bubble bath because you kids are driving me crazy. "
9726,"OK, what're we gonna do about this?"
9727,"Well, I guess we could tape Entertainment Tonight."
9728,"Not that, this, US. Oh my God, Ross, you-re, you're, it's jus-, you-, ever sin- you been here."
9729,"Ow, ow, OK. Alright, alright, Mon, Mon, you've gone ultrasonic again, alright."
9730,I just can't stand you being here all the time.
9731,"Why, why, why can't you stand me being here? I don't, I, we're just, ya know, we're just havin' fun."
9732,"Fun? Fun, you think this is fun?"
9733,"Yeah, c'mon I mean I though, you know, I thought we're just foolin' around. Like when, uh, when we were kids."
9734,"Ross, I hated you when we were kids."
9735,You hated me when we were kids?
9736,"Yes. I hated you. I mean I, I, loved you in a 'you're my brother so I have to' kind of way, but basically, yeah, I hated your guts."
9737,Why did you hate me?
9738,"Because, you were mean to me and you, you teased me and you always, always got your way."
9739,And that wasn't fun for you?
9740,Duh-huh!
9741,I can't believe you hated me.
9742,Now I love you. And not just 'cause I have to.
9744,Yeah. You're just gonna have to stop pissing me off.
9746,Then I won't have to k*ll you.
9747,"So you wanna watch uh, Entertainment Tonight?"
9748,"Yeah, thanks. You know what?"
9750,"If you really want to watch that Serengetti thing, you can."
9751,Ohh... OK. 
9754,"Listen. You are not going to believe this but, that is not me singing on the video."
9757,"Well, how did you find out?"
9758,"Well, OK, the record company sent over this piece of paper for me to sign, saying that it's OK for someone else to sing for me. That was my first clue."
9759,So what're you gonna do?
9760,"Well, I can't work with people who would do this."
9762,I mean this poor woman.
9763,What woman?
9764,"The voice woman. Ya know, I mean, she has a great voice but she doesn't have a video."
9765,"OK, Phoebs. But what about you?"
9766,"Well I have a video, you have to pay attention. No this, this voice woman, she's so talented but, according to the producer people, they said she doesn't have like the right look or something, ya know. I mean, it's like, she's like one of those an imals at the pound who like nobody wants 'cause they're not pretty enough or you know. Like, like some old dog who's just kind of like stinky and. Huuuuh, oh my God, she's smelly cat. Oh, oh that song has so many levels."
9767,"Hey Eddie, you uh, wanna play some foosball?"
9768,"No thanks man, I'm not uh, I'm not really into sports."
9769,"Yeah o-, OK, alright.  Doesn't matter, time for Baywatch."
9770,"Y-, y-, you like that show?"
9771,You don't like that show?
9772,"Wha-, n-, no. I mean it's just a bunch of pretty people runnin' around on the beach, ya know."
9773,Well that's the brilliance of it. The pretty people... and the running.
9774,"I tell ya, I-, I'm gonna go read in my room for a little while."
9775,"Oh o-, OK man."
9776,"Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, what are they feeding you? Everybody."
9777,"Smelly cat, smell-ly cat, it's not your fault."
9779,They won't take you to the vet.
9781,You're obviously not their favorite pet.
9783,It may not be a bed of roses.
9785,And you're no friend to those with noses.
9786,"Uh, Ross, those are the only lines we have, sorry. OK, you guys, once more."
9787,Oh Drake.
9788,I'm sorry Amber. It's just like Brad to have to have the last word.
9789,"I'm sorry I'm late, what happened?"
9790,"We, we just wanna see the end."
9791,I want you Drake.
9792,I know you do but you and I can never be together that way.
9794,There's something I never told you Amber. I'm actually your half- brother.
9795,So what happens next?
9796,"Well, I get the medical award for separating the siamese twins. Then Amber and I go to Venezuela to meet our other half-brother, Ramone. And that's where I find the world's biggest emerald. It's really big but it's cursed."
9797,God that is good TV.
9798,"Phoebs, play with meeee."
9799,"No. This game is grotesque. Twenty armless guys joined at the waist by a steel bar, forced to play soccer forever. Ahh, hello, human-rights violation."
9800,"Ya know Phoebs, don't feel so bad for 'em. After they're done playing, I break out the little plastic women and everybody has a pretty good time."
9801,Why don't you play with your roommate?
9802,"Ah he's a, he's not a big fan of foosball."
9803,"Uh oh, ooh, are we not getting along with the new boy?"
9804,"No he's, he's alright, just uh, he spends most of his time in his room."
9805,"Maybe that's because you haven't taken the time to get to know him. Let's remedy that, shall we?"
9806,We don't need to remedy that.
9807,"Oh yeah, it'll be fun. "
9809,"Hi, um, I just thought that it would be fun if the three of us had some beers and got to know each other."
9810,"Yeah alright, that sounds alright."
9811,"Oh good, ok. Oh nooo, I have to go because I'm late for my um, Green Eggs and Ham discussion group. Um tonight it's why he would not eat them on a train. Have fun bye."
9812,That was so lame.
9813,"I know, yeah. Ok, talk to him. "
9814,"So, you uh, you think that Speed Racer guy gets a lot of tickets er?"
9815,"That's good, that's good. So, so, so who broke up with who?"
9816,What're you kidding? I broke up with her. She actually thought that Sean Penn was the capital of Cambodia.
9817,"That's good man, when everybody knows that the uh, the capital of Cambodia is uh..."
9818,Well it's not Sean Penn.
9819,"Not Sean Penn. Alright, I, I've got a funny one, alright. My last girlfriend Tilly. Ok, we're eating breakfast, right, and I made all these pancakes, there was like 50 pancakes right. And all of the sudden she turns to me, alright, and she says, 'Eddie.' I say, 'yeah,' she says, 'Eddie, I don't want to see you anymore.' And it was literally like she had reached into my chest, ripped out my heart, and smeared it all over my life, ya know. And now there's like this incredible abyss, ya know, and I'm falling and I keep falling and I don't think I'm ever gonna stop.  That uh, wasn't such a funny story, was it?"
9820,"And a crusty old man said I'll do what I can and the rest of the rats played moroccas. That's it, thanks, good night."
9821,"Phoebe's got another job, right?"
9822,Great set tonight Phoebs.
9824,"Well, we should probably get going."
9825,"Um, we should go too, I got patients at 8 in the moring."
9826,"Ya know, I was thinking. Ya know how we always stay at your apartment? Well, I thought maybe tonight we'd stay at my place."
9827,"I don't know, I don't have my jammies."
9828,"Well, maybe you don't need them."
9829,"My baby sister, ladies and gentlemen."
9830,"Shut up, I'm happy."
9831,"Oh, this is so nice. Alright I have to make a speech. I just wanna say that of all the guys that Monica has been with, and that is a lot, I like you the best."
9832,"Oh, thank you Phoebs. That's very sweet."
9834,"Hear that? She likes me best, and apparently there've been a lot."
9835,"Not a lot, Phoebe's kidding, Phoebe's crazy."
9836,Phoebe's dead.
9839,I'm looking for Eddie Minowick.
9840,"Oh, uh, he's not here right now, uh, I'm Chandler, can I take a message, or, or a t*nk?"
9842,"Oh, oh, c'mon in."
9843,I'm Tilly.
9845,I gather by that oh that he told you about me.
9846,"Oh yeah, your uh, name came up in a uh, conversation that terrified me to my very soul."
9847,He's kind of intense huh?
9848,"Yes. Hey, can I ask you, is Eddie a little..."
9849,A little what?
9850,Bit country? C'mon in here you roomie.
9851,Hello Tilly.
9852,"Eddie, I just came by to drop off your t*nk."
9853,That's very thoughtful of you. It's very thougtful.
9854,"Well, ok then. I'm gonna go. Bye."
9857,"So, we gettin' a fish?"
9858,You had sex with her didn't you?
9859,"Phoebs, check it out, check it out, check it out, check it out."
9860,"Oh, ooh, Soap Opera Digest, oh that's one of my favorite digests."
9861,"Page 42, page 42, page 42."
9862,"Ok, ok, ok. Ooh, hey 'new doc on the block, Days of Our Lives' Joey Tribbiani.' Ooh, cool picture."
9863,"Ooh, I look good."
9864,"Hey is this true, that you write a lot of your own lines?"
9865,"Uh, well, kinda yeah. Like, remember last week when Alex was in the accident? Well the line in the script was, 'If we don't get this woman to a hospital, she's going to die.' But I made it, ' If this woman doesn't get to a hospital, she's not gonna live.'"
9866,"Ohh, ok, I see what you did there. Aren't you afraid though, that the writers are gonna be kinda mad when they read this?"
9867,"Huh? Never really thought about the writers. The scripts just kinda come to my house. But you know what? This makes me look good, which makes the show look good, which makes the writers look good so how could they be mad about that?"
9868,"Makes up most of his lines. Son-of-a-. Yeah, well, write this jerkweed."
9869,"I fall down an elevator shaft? What the hell does this mean, I fall down an elevator shaft?"
9870,"Uhh, I don't know, I just bring the scripts."
9871,"They can't k*ll me, I'm Francesca's long lost son."
9872,Right. Could you sign this?
9873,"No. No way, I'm not signing that."
9874,I don't think that's gonna affect the plot of the show.
9875,How can they do this to me?
9876,"Er, uh, I'm just gonna go. Sorry."
9877,"Well it wasn't that many guys. I mean, if you consider how many guys there actually are, it's a very small percentage."
9878,"Hey, it's not that big a deal, I was just curious."
9879,G'night.
9880,Night Richard. Good luck Mon.
9881,"Alright, before I tell you, uh, why don't you tell me how many women you've been with."
9883,"Two? TWO? How is that possible? I mean, have you seen you?"
9884,"Well, I mean what can I say? I, I was married to Barbara for 30 years. She was my high school sweetheart, now you, that's two."
9885,"Two it is. Ok, time for bed, I'm gonna go brush my teeth. "
9886,"Woah, woah, no wait a minute now. C'mon it's your turn. Oh c'mon. Ya know, I don't need the actual number, just a ballpark."
9887,"Ok, it is definitely less than a ballpark."
9888,"Wow, I am so glad I'm not Monica right now."
9889,"Tell me about it. So what, what's your magic number?"
9890,Uhhhooo.
9891,"C'mon, you know everyone I've been with. All, both of them."
9892,"Well, there's you."
9893,Better not be doin' these in order.
9894,"Ok, uh, Billy Dreskin, Pete Carney, Barry, and uh, oh, Paolo."
9895,"Oh yes, the weenie from Torrini."
9896,"Oh honey, are you jealous of Paolo? Oh, c'mon, I'm so much happier with you than I ever was with him."
9898,"Oh please. That Paolo thing was barely a relationship. All it really was was just, ya know, meaningless animal sex. Ok, ya know, that sounded soooo much better in my head."
9899,"Eddie, I didn't sleep with your ex-girlfriend."
9900,"That's very interesting, ya know, 'cause that's exactly what someone who slept with her would say."
9901,"This is nuts. This is crazy. She came over for like two minutes, dropped off a fish t*nk, and left, end of story."
9902,Where's Buddy?
9903,Buddy?
9904,"My fish, Buddy."
9905,There was no fish when she dropped it off.
9906,"Oh, this is, this is unbelievable. I mean, first you sleep with my ex-girlfriend then you insult my inteligenct by lying about it and then you k*ll my fish, my Buddy?"
9907,Hey I didn't k*ll your fish. Look Eddie... Would you look at what I'm doin' here. That can't be smart. So we're just gonna take this guy right off ya and put him here in Mr. Pocket. Tangellon? 
9908,That's it? That's the giant number you were afraid to tell me?
9909,Well yeah.
9910,"Well, that's not bad at all. I mean, you had me thinkin it was like a fleet."
9911,You really ok with it?
9912,"Oh honey, I'm fine."
9913,"Oh, yay. Ok about that two."
9914,"What? Alright, what about my two?"
9915,"Well, it just seems like a really small number."
9916,"Right, and..."
9917,"And, well, don't you have a lot of wild oats to sew? Or is that what you're doing with me? Oh my God, am I an oat?"
9918,"Honey, you are not an oat. I, I mean I don't know, I, I guess I'm just not an oat guy. I've only slept with women I've been in love with."
9919,But you've only slept with two people.
9921,"Wow. Oh wow. You know I love you too, right."
9922,Now I do. 
9923,"Ross, Ross, please listen to me. Ross, you are so much better for me than Paolo ever was. I mean you care about me, you're loving, you make me laugh."
9924,"Oh, hey, if I make you laugh, here's an idea, why don't you invite Paulo over and have a little romp in the sack and I'll just stand in the corner and tell knock-knock jokes."
9925,"God, Ross, look, what you and I have is special, all Paolo and I ever had was..."
9926,"Animal sex, animal sex? So what're you saying, I mean, you're saying that like, there's nothing between us animal at all. I mean there's not even like, uhm, a little animal, not even, not even like, like chipmunk sex?"
9927,"Ok, Ross, try to hear me. Ok, I, hey, I'm not gonna lie to you. Ok, it was good with Paolo."
9928,Knock-knock.
9929,"But, what you and I have is so much better. Ok, we have tenderness, we have intimacy, we connect. Ya know, I swear, this is the best I have ever had."
9930,Until now. 
9932,Hi. Richard just told me he loves me.
9933,"Oh my God, honey that's great."
9934,I know. I just can't find...
9935,Oh they're in the top drawer. Hurry.
9936,You need one too?
9937,Ooooh yeah.
9938,There's only one.
9940,"Hi. Uh, we'll be right there, we're just trying to decide something. "
9941,Rachel.  Hey.
9942,Hey. They're just trying to decide somehting.
9943,"Good, good, good. So, is uh, was your moustache, did, used to be different?"
9945,"Oh. How do you uh, ya know, keep it so neat?"
9946,I have a little comb.
9947,Oh. And what do you call that?
9948,A moustache comb.
9949,"Ok, I, I will do your laundry for one month."
9951,"Ok, ok, ok, I will, I will, I, hey, I will clean the apartment for two months."
9952,"Alright, I tell you what, I'll give this to you now if you can tell me where we keep the dustpan."
9953,Agghhh.
9954,So were you in Nam?
9955,Rock-paper-scissors?
9957,One two three. 
9958,Yeesss.
9959,"Fine, go have sex."
9960,"No. You have got it completely wrong. John Savage was deerhunter, no legs, John Voit was coming home, couldn't feel his legs."
9961,"No, no way. You've got it totally the other way around my friend. John Voit was..."
9963,"What, what oh...."
9964,Shall we?
9965,"It's not gonna happen. They're doing it tonight, we can do it tomorrow."
9966,"Uh, in the future, if I could see the schedule beforehand..."
9967,"So, when I woke up this morning, he'd stolen all the insoles out of my shoes."
9969,Because he thinks I slept with his ex-girlfriend and k*lled his fish.
9970,Why would you k*ll his fish?
9971,"Because sometimes, Phoebe after you sleep with someone, you have to k*ll the fish."
9972,"Chandler honey, I'm sorry. Ok, can we watch Joey's show now please? "
9974,"Wait, he's not here yet."
9975,"So, he's on the show, he knows what happens."
9978,"Oh, I'm fine about my problem now, by the way."
9979,Oh good.
9980,"Amber, I want you to know that I'll always be there for you, as a friend and as your brother."
9982,"Hard day huh? First the medical award, this."
9983,Some guys are just lucky I guess.
9984,"Dr. Remore, report to first floor emergency, stat."
9985,"Well then, uh, I uhh, guess that's me. Anyone else need to go on the elevator? Dr. Horton, Dr. Wong?"
9986,"No, no, they only said you."
9987,"Oh, ok. Alright."
9988,I love you Drake.
9989,"Yeah, whatever. Oh no."
9990,"Drake, look out."
9991,Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh.
9992,Did they just k*ll off Joey?
9993,No.  Now maybe.
9996,Open up. We want to talk to you.
9997,I don't feel like talkin.
9998,"Oh c'mon Joey, we care about you."
9999,We're worried about you.
10000,And some of us really have to pee.
10001,Sorry Joey 
10003,"Listen, sorry about your death, that really sucks."
10004,We came over as soon as we saw.
10005,How could you not tell us?
10006,"I don't know, I was kinda hopin' no one would ever find out."
10007,"Well, maybe they can find a way to bring you back."
10008,"Naa, they said that when they found my body, my brain was so smashed in that the only doctor that could have saved me was me. Supposed to be some kind of irony or somethin."
10009,"But Joey, you're gonna be fine. You don't need that show, it was just a dumb soap opera."
10010,"Phoebe, this was the greatest thing that ever happened to me."
10011,"Yes, I was going to incorporate that. Oh good, here's Monica, she'll have something nice to say."
10012,"Um, I straightened out your shower curtain so you won't get mildew. What? To me that's nice."
10013,It's gonna be ok. You know that?
10014,"No, I don't. It's like, ya know, you work your whole life for somethin' and you think that when you get it it's never gonna be as good as you thought it would be. But this so was. Ya know, it changed everything. Like the other day, I got this credit card application, and I was pre- approved. Huh? I've never been pre-approved for anything in my life."
10015,I'm sorry man.
10016,"Yeah, Joey honey, I don't know if this'll mean anything to you but you'll always be pre-approved with us."
10017,"No, that means nothin to me."
10018,Uhhhaahh.
10019,"Pecan sandy, just made em."
10020,"Yeah alright. What're these, raisins?"
10021,"Uh, sure, why not."
10022,"Listen Eddie, um, I've been thinking about our current living situation and uh, why are you smiling?"
10023,"I got a little surprise, look. There's a new fishie. I named him uh, Chandler, you know, after, after you."
10024,"Well that's not an, even a real fish. No, that's a goldfish cr*cker."
10025,What's you point man?
10026,"Ok, good night.  You big freak of nature."
10030,"Ohh, brisk tonight."
10031,Oh man.
10032,Let's never speak of this.
10034,Hey Eddie. Daahh!! What're you doin' here?
10035,"Nothin' roomie, just watchin' you sleep."
10037,"Makes me feel um, peaceful, heh-heh, please."
10038,I can't sleep now.
10039,You want me to sing?
10040,"No, look, that's it, it's over, I want you out, I want you out of the apartment now."
10041,"Woah, woah, woah, what're, what're you talkin' about man."
10042,Hannibal Lecter...better roommate than you.
10043,"No. See now I don't think you're being fair. I mean one night you see me and you get scared, I mean, what about all the other nights when you don't see me, huh? What about last night when you went and got a drink of water and I was nice enough to hide behind the door, what's that about, huh?"
10044,I didn't realize that.
10046,GET OUT NOW!!
10047,"Ok, you really want me out?"
10049,"Ok, then I want to hear you say it, I, I want to hear you say you want me out."
10050,I want you out.
10051,"No no no, I wanna hear it from your lips."
10052,Where did you hear it from before?
10053,"Oh, right, all right, you know what pallie I understand, consider me gone, you know what, I'll be out by the time you get home from work tomorrow."
10054,I heard that.
10057,"Hey. Whe-ell, look at you, finally got that time machine workin' huh?"
10058,"Seriously, you like it? This guy was sellin' them on 8th avenue and I looked at 'em and I though, you know what I don't have?"
10059,A mirror?
10060,"Fine, make fun. I think it's jaunty."
10061,"Wow, for a guy who's recently lost his job, you're in an awfully good mood."
10062,"Hey, I'll be alright. I mean it's not like I'm starting from sqare one. I was Dr. Drake Remoray on Days of Our Lives. Heh? I mean that's gotta have some kind of cache."
10063,Cache? Jaunty?
10064,Chandler gave me word of the day toilet paper. I'm gonna get some coffee.
10068,"Oooh, so so so, did you read the book?"
10069,"Oh my God, it was incredible."
10070,Didn't it like totally speak to you?
10071,"Woah, woah, woah, what book is this?"
10072,Rachel you have to read this book. It's called Be Your Own Windkeeper. It's about how women need to become more empowered.
10073,"Yeah and oh, and but there's, there's wind and the wind can make us Goddesses. But you know who takes out wind? Men, they just take it."
10074,Men just take out wind?
10075,"Ya-huh, all the time, cause they are the lightning bearers."
10078,"Well that sounds kinda cool, kinda like The Hobbit."
10079,"It is nothing like the Hobbit. It's like reading about every relationship I've ever had, except for Richard."
10080,"Oh yes, no, Richard would never steal your wind."
10082,"No, 'cause he's yummy."
10083,Yes. But all the other ones.
10084,"Oh yes. Oh and, the part about how they're always like drinking from out pool of inner power, but God forbid we should take a sip."
10085,Anybody want a croan.
10086,"Ok, this is a typical lightning-bearer thing. Right there, it's like, um, 'Hello, who wants one of my fallic shaped man cakes?'"
10087,Don't worry about it already. Things happen.
10088,"So, you're not mad at me for getting fired and everything?"
10089,"Joey, look at me, look at me. Do I have lipstick on my teeth?"
10090,"No, can we get back to me?"
10091,"Look honey, people get fired left and right in this business. I already got you an audition for Another World."
10092,Alright. Cab driver number two?
10094,But I was Dr. Drake Remoray. How can I go from bein' a neurosurgeon to drivin' a cab?
10095,"Things change, roll with em."
10096,"But this is a two line part, it's like takin' a step backwards. I'm not gonna do this."
10097,"Joey, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told Al Minser and his pyramid of dogs. Take any job you can get and don't make on the floor."
10098,I'm sorry. See ya.
10099,"Oh, God, oh, God, I mean it's just so."
10100,Isn't it.
10101,"Uhh, I mean this is like reading about my own life. I mean this book could have been called 'Be Your Own Windkeeper Rachel'."
10102,I don't think it would have sold a million copies but it would have made a nice gift for you.
10103,Hey you guys.
10105,"Uh, sweetie we've gotta go."
10106,NO!
10108,"No, why do we always have to do everything according to your time table?"
10109,Actually it's the movie theatre that has the time schedule. So you don't miss the beginning.
10110,"No, see this isn't about the movie theatre, this is about you stealing my wind."
10111,You go girl. I can't pull that off can I?
10112,"Excuse me, your, your, your wind?"
10113,"Yes, my wind. How do you expect me to grow if you won't let me blow?"
10114,"You, you know I, I don't, have a- have a problem with that."
10115,"Ok, I just, I just really need to be with myself right now. I'm sorry."
10116,"Um-um, um-um."
10117,"You're right, I don't have to apologize. Sorry. Damnit!"
10119,"I, I don't know, it's got all this stuff about wind and trees and there's some kind of sacred pool in it. I mean, I don't really get it but she's, she's pretty upset about it."
10120,"See, this is why I don't date women who read. Uh-oh."
10121,"What, what's that?"
10122,It's my VISA bill. Envelope one of two. That can't be good.
10123,"Open it, open in."
10126,"Look at this, how did I spend so much money?"
10127,"Uh Joey, that's just the minumum amount due, that's your total due."
10129,"What, woah, woah, $3500 at porcelain safari?"
10130,"My animals. Hey the guy said they suited me, he spoke with an accent, I was all confused. I don't know what I'm gonna do."
10131,Well I guess you can start by drivin a cab on Another World.
10133,That audition.
10134,That's a two line part.
10135,"Joey, you owe $1100 at I Love Lucite."
10136,So what.
10137,"So suck it up man, it's a job, it's money."
10138,"Hey, look, I don't need you getting all judgemental and condescending and pedantic."
10139,Toilet paper?
10141,"Look, I'm not being any of those things, ok, I'm just being realistic."
10142,"Well knock it off, you're supposed to be my friend."
10143,I am your friend.
10144,"Well then tell me things like, 'Joey you'll be fine,' and, 'Hang in there,' and, and, 'Somethin' big's fonna come along, I know it.'"
10145,But I don't know it. What I do know is that you owe $2300 at Isn't it Chromantic.
10146,"Hey Ross, I'm aware of what I owe."
10147,"Ok, well then get some sense. I mean it took you what, 10 years to get that job, who knows how long it's gonna be till you get another."
10148,"Look, I don't wanna hear this right now."
10149,"Huh, I'm just saying..."
10150,Well don't just say.
10151,"Ya know, maybe, maybe I should just go."
10153,"Ok. I'll see ya later. Just think about it, ok."
10154,"I don't need to think about it. I was Dr. Drake Remoray. That was huge. Big things are gonna happen, you'll see. Ross, you still there?"
10155,Hey pal.
10156,Ahhhh-gaaaahhh. Eddie what're you still doin' here?
10157,"Ah, just some basic dehydrating of a few fruits and vegetables. MAN ALIVE this thing's fantastic!"
10158,"Look Eddie, aren't you forgetting anything?"
10159,"Oh yeah, that's right, look I got us a new goldfish. He's a lot fiestier that the last one."
10160,"Maybe 'cause the last one was made by Pepperidge Farm. Look Eddie, isn't there something else you're supposed to be doing right now?"
10161,"Well, not unless it's got something to do with dehydrating my man because right now I'm a dehydrating maniac!"
10162,Look you have to help me out here. I thought we had a deal. I thought by the time...
10163,"Ah-ah-ah, you know what that is?"
10164,Your last roommate's kidney?
10165,That's a tomato. This one definitely goes in the display.
10166,"Hey g*n, let me get a lemonade to go."
10167,Lemonade? You ok man?
10168,"Ah, it's career stuff. I don't know if you heard but they k*lled off my character on the show."
10169,"Oh, that's too bad. How'd they do it?"
10170,I fell down an elevator shaft.
10171,That sucks. I was buried in an avalanche.
10173,I used to be Bryce on All My Children.
10174,Daaahhhh!
10175,Aaahhhhhhh! Aaahhhh!
10176,"Why must everybody watch me sleep? There'll be no more watching me sleep, no more watching."
10177,I wa-
10178,Uuuh.
10179,"Hey man, check it out, I got some great stuff to dehydrate here. I got some grapes, got some apricots, I thought it would be really cool to see what happens with these water balloons."
10180,"Get out. Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out."
10182,"You, move out. Take your fruit, your stupid small fruit and GET OUT!"
10183,"You, you want, you want me to move out?"
10185,"I uh, I gotta tell you man, I mean, that's uh, it's kinda out of the blue, I mean don't you think?"
10186,"This is not out of the blue, this is smack dab in the middle of the blue."
10187,"Ohhhh. Relax, take it easy buddy. Tell me twice, you want me to go? Alright, alright, guess I'll be back for my stuff.  But if you think for one second I'm leaving you alone with my fish, you're insane Jack!"
10188,You want some help.
10189,No help required Chico. 
10190,"All the way to the airport huh? You know that's over 30 miles, that's gonna cost you about so bucks."
10191,"Excuse me, that's 50 bucks."
10193,Five oh dollars.
10194,"Ohh, you know what it is? It's smudgy 'cause they're fax pages. Now when I was on Days of Our Lives as Dr. Drake Remoray, they'd send over the whole script on real paper and everything. "
10196,"And, and just so you know, if you wanted to expand this scene like, like have the cab crash or somethin', I could attend to the victims 'cause I have a background in medical acting."
10197,"Ok, listen, thanks for coming in."
10198,"No no, uh, don't thank me for comin' in. Uh, at least let me finish. Uh, we could take the expressway but uh, this time of day you're better off taking the budge. You were goin' for the word bridge there weren't ya. I'll have a good day. "
10199,"Ok, question number 28, have you ever allowed a lighning bearer to take your wind? I would have to say no."
10200,And I would have to say pah-huh.
10202,Do you not remember the puppet guy?
10203,Yeah you like totally let him wash his feet in the pool of your inner power.
10204,And his puppet too.
10205,"Yeah ok, well at least I didn't let some guy into the forest of my righteous truth on the first date."
10207,Paul.
10209,"Ok, ok, ok, moving on, moving on, next question. Ok number 29, have you ever betrayed another goddess for a lightning bearer? Ok, number 30."
10210,"Woah, woah, woah, let's go back to 29."
10211,"Not uh, not to my recollection."
10212,"Huuh, alright, Danny Arshak, ninth grade. Oh, c'mon Rach, you know the bottle was totally pointing at me."
10213,Only 'cause you took up half the circle.
10214,Listen to you two. It's so sad. Looks like I'm gonna be going to the goddess meetings alone.
10215,Well not when they find out you slept with Jason Hurley an hour after he broke up with Monica.
10216,One hour? You are such a leaf blower.
10217,"Oh hey uh, be careful with that 3-D last supper, Judas is a little loose."
10218,"Oh my God, what's goin' on?"
10219,They're takin all my stuff back. I guess you were right.
10220,"No look I wasn''t right, that's what I came here to tell you. I was totally hung up on, on my own stuff. Listen, I'm someone who needs the whole security thing, ya know. To know exactly where my next paycheck is coming from buy you, you don't need that and that's amazing to me. I could never do what you do Joey."
10221,Thanks Ross.
10222,Yeah. And you should hold out for something bigger. I can't tell you how much respect I have for you not going to that stupid cab driver audition.
10223,I went.
10224,"Great, how did it go?"
10225,I didn't get it.
10228,You're livin' the dream.
10230,All right then.
10231,"Oh, not my parrot."
10233,I can't watch this.
10234,"Hey hold on, hold on. How much for the uh, how much to save the bird?"
10235,1200.
10236,Dollars? You spent $1200 dollars on a plastic bird?
10237,"Uhhh, I was an impulse buyer, near the register."
10238,"Go ahead, go ahead with the bird. Ok, do you have anything for around 200?"
10239,"Uh, the dog. "
10242,I'll take it. My gift to you man.
10243,Thanks Ross. I really like that bird though...I'll take the dog though.
10244,Here are your cakes.
10245,We didn't order cake.
10246,"No, I know, they're from me. Look you guys this is not good. I mean we have enough trouble with guys stealing our wind without taking it from each other."
10247,You're right.
10248,You know.
10249,I love you goddesses. I don't ever want to suck your wind again.
10250,Thank you. So are we good?
10251,We're good.
10252,We're good?
10254,"Ok, let me take these cakes back 'cause they're gonna take that out of my paycheck."
10255,"Ding dong, the psycho's gone."
10256,Are you sure this time?
10257,"Yes, yes I actually saw him leave. I mean that guy is standing in the window holding a human head. He is STANDING IN THE WINDOW HOLDING A HUMAN HEAD!"
10258,"Check it out man, I tore it off some mannaquin in the alley behind Macy's."
10259,There is no alley behind Macy's.
10260,"So I got it in the junior miss department, big diff. Anyway check it out man, it's gonna make a hell of a conversation piece at out next cocktail party, huh pal?"
10261,Our next cocktail party?
10262,"Yeah, you know, put chips in it, we'll make like a chip chick."
10263,"Eddie, do you remember yesterday?"
10264,"Uh yes, I think I vaguely recall it."
10265,Do you remember talking to me yesterday?
10266,"Uh, yes."
10267,So what happened?
10268,We took a road trip to Las Vegas man.
10269,Oh sweet Moses.
10270,"So on this road trip, did you guys win any money?"

10278,"It's Eddie you freak, your roommate."
10279,"I, I'm sorry, I uh  I already have a roommate. "
10281,"Yeah, he's lived here for years, I don't, I don't know what you're talking about man."
10282,"No he, he moved out and I moved in."
10283,"Well I, I think we'd remember something like that."
10284,I know I would.
10285,"Well that's uh, that's a good point. Um ok, well, uh, I guess I got the wrong apartment then. I, I'm, look, I'm, ya know, I'm sorry, I'm terriably sorry."

10293,Ah that's a cantelope.
10294,"Hey look, are we gonna have to bring this out every time Ross comes over?"
10295,He paid a lot of money for it.
10296,"I'm gonna hold him a different way. Look I don't understand, if you hated it so much, why did you buy it in the first place?"
10297,"Well, I had a whole ceramic zoo thing goin' over there but now, without the other ones, it just looks tacky."
10298,"So is he housetrained or is he gonna leave little bathroom tiles all over the place? Stay. Good, STAY! Good fake dog."

10304,"C'mon, happy family gets a dog, frontier fun."
10305,"Yeah but Phoebs, what about the end?"
10306,What when Yeller saves saves the family from the wolf and everyone's happy?
10307,That's not the end.
10308,Yu-huh. That's when my mother would shut off the TV and say 'The end'.
10309,What about the part where he has rabies?
10310,"He doesn't have rabies, he has babies. That's what my mom said."
10311,"Uh, Phoebe, I don't think your mom would want you to see what's about to happen."
10312,"What, what's about to happen?  I've never seen this part before. Hey, Travis, watcha doin' with that g*n? Oh no, no no Travis, put down the g*n. No no no no, he he's your buddy, he's your Yeller, no, no no, the end, THE END.  "
10313,"Hey, have you guys eaten, because uh, Richard and I just finished and we've got leftovers... Chicken and potatoes... What am I wearing?...Actually, nothing but rubber gloves."
10314,"Ya know, one of these times you're gonna really be naked and we're not gonna come over."
10315,"Alright, I've got a leg, three breasts and a wing."
10316,"Well, how do you find clothes that fit?"
10317,"Oh, hey, Monica, we've got a question."
10318,"Alright, for the bizillionth time, yes I see other women in shower at the gym, and no I don't look."
10319,"No, not that one. We're trying to figure out who to bring to the Knicks game tonight, we have an extra ticket."
10320,"Yeah, Ross can't go so it's between my friend Eric Prower who has breath issues and Dan with the poking.  'Did you see that play? Do you want some more beer? Is that Spike Lee?'"
10321,"Ok.  Hey, why don't you ask Richard?"
10322,"Ok, uh, hey Richard, if you had an extra ticket to the Knicks game and you had to choose between a friend who smells and one who bruises you who would you pick?"
10323,"Wow. Well being a huge Knicks fan myself, I think you should take someone who's a huge Knicks fan."
10324,"Ok, that's Eric."
10325,Glad to be of help. Matches. 
10326,"I meant, why don't you take Richard to the game? What?"
10328,C'mon. Keeps his fingers to himself and he's always minty fresh.
10329,"I don't know, Richard's really nice and everything, uh, it's just that we don't know him really well, ya know, and plus he's, ya know, old  -er than some people, but, uh, younger than some buildings."
10330,"So what, he's a little older, big deal, I mean he's important to me. Ya know if you ask him, he might take you on his Jag. "
10331,How do we say yes now and make it seem like we're not doin' it just to ride in the cool car?
10332,"Ok, this could be tough."
10333,"Ok ok ok ok. Monica, we'll bring him, but only if he takes the Jaguar."
10334,"Ooh, you almost had it."
10335,"No no, you're fine, you're fine."
10336,Hello
10339,Hi honey.
10340,Oh you guys are not gonna believe what happened.
10343,"Ok, we were sitting over there playing on the floor and he grabs the table and he pulls himself up. He pulled himself up. Standing man. I'm sorry you guys missed it but I did tape it so it you guys want to see it."
10344,"Uhh, we know, he already did it last week."
10345,You can watch our tape if you want. 
10346,"I don't believe this. I miss, I miss the first time of everything. I missed, what, the first time he rolled over, the first time he crawled. What else did I miss? Has he spoken yet, is he driving, does he have a favorite liquour?"
10347,"Actually, he is getting closer on the talking thing. He can't quite say mama yet, but once he said yumen."
10348,"Ooh, I, I'm so sick of missing stuff. Ya know, I want him for more than, than a day, I want him for a whole weekend. No listen , I mean, I feel like-"
10349,Great. That would be fine.
10350,"Really? I mean, I, I had a whole speach prepared."
10351,"Oh shout, that would have been fun."
10352,"Oh look, did, did you just see that? Did you see? He just waved, he just waved, he's never waved before, you've never waved before. Yes he has. Very good."
10354,"Hey Phoebs, whatcha got there?"
10355,"Ok, Love Story, Brian's Song, and Terms of Endearment."
10356,"Wow, all you need now is The k*lling Fields and some guacamole and you've got yourself a part-ay."
10357,"Yeah, I talked to my grandma about the Old Yeller incident, and she told me that my mom used to not show us the ends of sad movies to shield us from the pain and sadness. You know, before she k*lled herself."
10361,"Hey. Where is he, where's Richard? Did you ditch him?"
10362,"Yeah right after we stole his lunch money and gave him a wedgie. What's the matter with you, he's parking the car."
10363,So'd you guys have fun?
10364,Your boyfriend is so cool.
10366,"Yeah, he let us drive his Jaguar. Joey for 12 blocks, me for 15."
10367,"Wow, he must like you the best."
10368,"Oh, what about that thing he did when he tipped the guy who showed us to our seats. You never even saw the money, it was like this.  Hey Chandler, thanks for showing us to our seats ."
10369,"You're welcome. Hey Joey, thanks for parking the car ."
10370,No problem. Hey Chandler
10371,I think they get it.
10373,There's the man.
10374,He-he-eyy. 
10375,"Hey, you're gettin' better. I'm gonna keep this by the way."
10376,Ok. He kept my dollar.
10377,"So your first whole weekend without Ben, what're you guys gonna do?"
10378,"Uh, we're going down to Colonial Williamsburg."
10379,"Yeah, a woman I went to college with just became the first female blacksmith down there."
10380,"Well, ya know, they're a little behind the times in Colonial Williamsburg."
10381,Think I better go before mommy starts weeping.
10382,Buy mommy.
10383,We love you. Buy.
10384,"Have a good time. Ok, Ben."
10387,"Look.  Joey, do you know we can see you from here?"
10388,How come Richard looks so much cooler with one of these than me?
10389,"Well for starters, you may want to light it and lose the spatula."
10390,"You know what, I think it's cute, you trying to be more like Richard."
10391,"Not like him, per-se, just not un-like him."
10392,Look it's the artist formerly known as Chandler.
10393,"Just tryin' somethin' here, ya know."
10394,"So Joey, why didn't you grow a moustache?"
10395,"Oh we flipped for it. I got the cigar, he got the moustache. Figured if we both grew it, we'd look like dorks."
10396,"Yeah, you really sidestepped that land mine."
10397,"Hey listen, we've gotta go, I promised Richard we'd meet him downstairs."
10398,You're meeting Richard?
10399,"Yeah, we're goin' to a Ranger game."
10400,"Yeah, didn't he tell ya?"
10401,"Well, he told me he was going out with the guys, I just didn't know that you were the guys."
10402,You hear that? We're the guys.
10403,We're the guys.
10404,With that moustache doesn't Chandler remind you of Aunt Sylvia?
10406,"Hi, we're visitiing. It's Ben and his da-da. Da-da. Can you say da-da? Look, I'm gonna tell your momies you said it anyway so you might as well try."
10407,No luck huh?
10408,"Naa. A while ago I got a sah out of him, which I thought, ya know, might turn into sah-condary caregiver but... Hey, would you uh, would you hold him for a sec, 'cause I, I gotta take this off."
10409,"Oh, yeah sure, Ok. "
10411,"Uh, I'm holding Ben."
10412,"Yeah, well, he's a baby not a b*mb."
10414,Well just hold him like you'd hold a football.
10415,This is how I would hold a football.
10416,"Ok, here, here. There we go."
10417,"Ok, I'm sorry, I'm just not very good with babies. I mean I haven't been around them, I mean, you know, since I was one."
10418,"It's alright, it's no big deal."
10420,"Yeah, definitely, I'm sure you'll feel totally different when it's our baby."
10423,You think about stuff like that?
10424,"Uhh, yeah. I mean, actually I kinda think that we'll have, we'll have two babies."
10425,"Two, two babies?"
10426,"Yeah. Ya know, a boy and a girl. Hopefully the girl will come first so Ben here won't feel too competitive."
10427,Then what's gonna happen?
10428,"Well, we won't wanna raise kids in the city so we'll probably move to uh, Scarsdale."
10430,"Yeah, that way I figure, ya know, we'll be far enough away from our parents that we don't have to see them all the time but close enough that they can come over and babysit whenever we want. And yes, I know, the taxes are a little higher than, let's say, Nassau county but the school system's supposedly great."
10431,"Wow. Wow, that's great. Great. Ok, wow, you know what."
10433,"I'm off my break now so uh, um here you take this  and um, I am gonna go pour these very nice people some coffee. Ok. Oh look at that, I don't have a pot. I don't have a pot. Well, hey, maybe I've got one at home, or in Scarsdale. Hey is that a door? "
10435,"Hey Phoebs, what's happening?"
10436,"Oh, ok, m*rder, cancer, soccer teams eating each other in the Andes."
10437,So you watched the movies huh?
10438,"Uh huh, what is happening to the world? I mean, no no no, 'cause ET leaves, and and Rocky loses, Charlotte dies."
10439,Charlotte who?
10440,"With the web, the spider she dies, she does. She has babies and dies. It's like ya know, hey welcome home from the hospital, thud."
10441,"Alright, you wanna feel better?"
10443,"Ok, here, watch this."
10444,It's a Wonderful Life. Yes I've heard of this.
10445,"So you can't lose, it's there in the title. Wonderfullness is baked right in."
10446,"Please, I almost fell for that with, uh, Pride of the Yankees, I thought I was gonna see a film about Yankee pride and then, boom, the guy gets Lou Gehrig's disease."
10447,"Uh, the guy was Lou Gehrig. Didn't you kinda see it coming?"
10448,"Phoebe, just watch that, I promise it will resotre all your faith in humanity."
10449,"Hey, big guy, game time."
10450,"Hey, be right there."
10451,There's a game?
10452,"Uh, yeah, I just got my pick-up sticks back from the shop. Bring your nerves of steel."
10453,It's the basketball playoffs.
10454,"Listen, um honey, I appreciate this but you don't have to keep hanging out with them for me, I mean, they have each other."
10455,"Oh, no, honey, I mean, don't worry, I like hanging out with those guys. It's fun for me. They're different than my other friends, they don't start sentences with, 'You know who just d*ed shoveling snow?'"
10456,"Alright that's great, then just go. Go Knicks."
10457,"Uh, it's the college playoffs."
10458,"Oh, then go Vassar."
10459,"Uh, they're not in it."
10460,"Ok, then just go."
10461,Ok. 
10462,"Oh, why does this bother me so much? I mean I don't wanna be one of those people who tells their boyfriend they wanna spend 24 hours a day with them."
10464,"It's just that he doesn't have that much free time, ya know, and I don't know, what do I do?"
10465,Does it matter? You're ultimately just gonna die or get divorced or have to blow your pets head off.
10466,Aghh.
10467,Me too. 
10468,I've got a question. Richard made plans again with the guys.
10469,"Yeah well, Ross just made plans for the whole century."
10470,"Ya know what, I think I'm gonna go to my room and read Cosmo, maybe there's something helpful in there. Know what, at least maybe I can learn how to do an at home bikini wax with leftover Cristmas candles."
10471,"Ok, what the hell happened back there?"
10472,"I don't know, you tell me. One minute I'm holding Ben like a football, the next thing I know, I've got two kids, I'm living in Scarsdale complaining about the taxes."
10473,"Well I'm sorry, I think about stuff. Ya know, I mean, you're at work, you're assembling bones, your mind wanders."
10474,"Ross, you have planned out the next 20 years of our lives, we've been dating for six weeks."
10475,"C'mon, what, you never think about our future?"
10476,"Yes, but I, I think about who's apartment we're gonna sleep at tomorrow night and, and where we're gonna have dinner next Saturday night. I do not think about what our childrens' names are gonna be. You know what our childrens names are gonna be."
10477,"No, no, I mean, ya know, I, I read a book and there was a girl named Emily and I thought, I thought that might be good."
10478,What was the book?
10479,The big book of childrens' names.
10480,"Ok, Ross, Ross, ok listen, what we have is amazing."
10482,"But I do not want to have everything decided for me. I spent my whole life like that. It's what I had with Barry, that was one of the reasons I left. I, I like not knowing right now and I'm sorry if that scares you but if you want to be with me you are gonna have to deal with that."
10483,Ok fine.
10485,We're not done.
10486,I didn't know that.
10487,"Ok, then you're gonna have to understand that you're with a guy who's not gonna stop planning his future with you because he knows that we're gonna end up together and if that scares you, tough, 'cause you're gonna have to deal with that."
10488,"Fine, I will."
10489,"Good, 'cause I love you."
10492,Well I love you too.
10493,Well that's the first time we've said that.
10494,Yes it is.
10495,"Well, I'm gonna kiss you."
10496,Well you better.
10497,Hey. Oh thanks for the great movie tip.
10498,Did you like it?
10499,"Oh yeah. You know, I don't know if I was happier when um George Bailey destroyed the family business or um, Donna Reid cried, or when the mean pharmacist made his ear bleed."
10500,"Alright, I'll give you the ear thing but don't you think the ending was pretty wonderful?"
10501,"I didn't watch the ending, I was too depressed. It just kept getting worse and worse, it should have been called, ""It's a sucky life and just when you think it can't suck any more it does."""
10502,Kick save and... denied.
10503,"But... he gets it back, pass to the middle, lines it up and... BAM! Yes! Could that sh*t BE any prettier?"
10504,Man you are incredible.
10505,"Well, we had a table in college."
10506,"Oh really, I didn't know they had foosball in the 1800's."
10507,Nice moustache by the way. When puberty hits that thing's really gonna kick in.
10508,"Honey. Uh, not to sound too Florence Henderson but, dinner's on the table."
10509,"Ok, just one more point."
10510,Score! Now can we go?
10511,"See, that's why we don't let her play."
10512,Is everything all right?
10513,Um-hmm.
10515,"Oh hey listen, don't be mad at him, it's our fault. I'm sorry we've been hoggin so much of his time."
10516,"Yeah, he's just really great to hang around with."
10517,Well.
10518,"No no, seriously, Chandler and I were just talkin about this. He is so much cooler than our dads.  I mean, you know, our dad's are ok, ya know, but Richard is just- ow, ow. What are you kickin me for? Huh? I'm tryin to talk here."
10519,"Uh, you guys see me as a dad?"
10522,Nooooo.
10523,"Your just, your just clearly not familiar with our young persons vernacular. See, when we say dad, we mean buddy. We mean pal."
10524,"Uh-huh, yeah."
10525,"No no, seriously, Joey's my dad, Monica's my dad. I've even got some dads down at work."
10526,"That's fine. Well, your other dad and I are gonna go have a romantic evening and I guess I'll just see you kids around."
10527,Nighty-nite.
10528,You're not a dad. You're not a dad.
10529,Not a dad.
10530,I can't believe you got us into trouble. 
10531,So are you ok?
10532,"Yeah, just, I feel like I'm about a hundred. I thought I was just one of the guys."
10533,"Come here. I'll make you feel like one of the guys. You know for a really cool guy, you suck at foosball."
10534,"What're you talkin' about, I was killin' 'em."
10535,"Yeah, well they suck too."
10536,"Ok, and then you take the poopie diaper and you put it in the poopie diaper pail."
10537,"Ok Ross, just so you know, calling it a poopie diaper doesn't make this process any cuter."
10539,It's us.
10540,Come on up. I'm gonna get the rest of his stuff together. 
10541,"Ok, we can do this now, can't we Ben? Yes we can, yes we can.  There. I did it. I did it. Look at that, oh, stays on and everything. Hi."
10543,"I'm sorry, what did you just say? Did you just say hi? Oh my God, Ross, Ross, Ben just said 'Hi'."
10544,"Wha, what?"
10545,Ben just said hi.
10546,"What, the word hi?"
10547,"Ye-, no, my Uncle Hi."
10548,"Great, great, and I miss that too, I miss everything."
10549,"Oh, I'm sorry, I guess I just bring it out in him."
10551,Guess what. Ben just said his first word.
10552,What did he say?
10553,Something about hi.
10554,That's so exciting.
10555,Mommy is so proud of you. Hi. Hi.
10556,"You know, actually it's more like, hi."
10564,"Ok, this could go on for a while."
10565,We've got a cab waiting downstairs.
10566,"Well, this was fun. Uh, we should really do it again sometime, wha'dya say? Ok. Alright so I've got him."
10567,Tuesday.
10568,"Tuesday right. Ok, bye you guys."
10570,Bye Ben.
10572,"Did, did he just, did he, did he just say, he said bye. He said bye. You said, you said bye to me. You said bye to me."
10573,Suddenly I'm seeing him go off to college.
10574,"We've gotta go, we've got that cab waiting."
10575,"Alright, alright, ok. Bye."
10582,"Oh wow, look at this nice deep hole I've been digging. Hey Bert, isn't this a nice hole here. Hey."
10583,"Ok, Ben, this is the part where Ernie buries Bert in the sand and can't find him. Now, I've looked ahead on the tape and he does find him again. But, ok, before that happens, there's some pretty rough goin' for a while but I think we can handle it. And, there's just the alphabet but we know that ends well so. Ok, here we go. "
10584,"Bert, Bert. Bert. Hey, what happened to my friend Bert? He was here just a moment ago. Oh no, my old friend Bert is lost."
10585,"Oh, I'm so glad you're here."
10586,"Hey Monica, why are we watchin' the business channel?"
10587,"'Cause I was going by it the other day and I saw that there was a stock with my initials, MEG, on it and, well, sometimes I have to watch for two or three hours before it comes up again but when it does, it's pretty exciting."
10588,"Ok honey, you really need a job."
10589,"Mon, speaking of which, dad says he knows someone you can call for an interview."
10591,"Ok, right there. That, that's the third sign today. Right there."
10592,"On behalf of everyone, I'd just like to say behuh."
10593,"No, 'cause you just said dad and everywhere I go today I keep getting signs telling me to go see my father. Like when I was walking over here and I passed a buffet...which is my father's last name."
10595,And they were serving franks which is his first name minus the s at the end. And there was a rotisserie with spinning chicken.
10596,His indian name?
10597,No because I chickened out the last time when I tried to meet him. So I mean coincidences? I don't think so.
10598,Freakish.
10600,Freaky.
10601,"Weird, weird."
10602,"Ok, so uh, who wants the last hamburger?"
10603,"Oh, alright, that's it, now I have to go see him."
10605,"Hamburger. McDonald's. Old MacDonald had a farm, my dad is a pharmacist."
10606,"Man, I am so b*at."
10608,"Hey, you just wanna forget about raquetball and hang out here?"
10609,Yeah alright.
10610,Hey you're in our seats.
10611,"Oh, sorry we didn't know."
10612,"Hey, we were sitting there."
10613,"Ok, there is one more way to say it, who knows it?"
10614,Is that supposed to be funny?
10615,"No actually, I was just going for colorful."
10616,What's with this guy?
10617,What's with you?
10618,"Uh, nothing, nothing's with him. Enjoy your coffee."
10619,What just happened?
10620,"I just took your hat. See, I can be funny too. My, my joke is that I, I took your hat."
10621,"That, that is funny. Can I have it back?"
10625,"Ok, ok, you know what? I think you're very funny. Kudos on that hat joke. But, come on guy just, just give him back the hat."
10626,Why should we?
10627,"Because it's a special hat.  See he bought it 'cause he was feeling really down one day so he got the hat to cheer himself up, ya know. Now Chandler..."
10628,"Stop talking, stop talking now. Let me just get this straight. You're actually stealing my hat?"
10629,You got a problem with that?
10630,"No, just wanna make sure we're on the same page."
10631,"Hey, how'd the interview go?"
10632,It bit. It was a 50's theme restraunt. I have to cook in a costume and dance on the counter. I mean I was a chef at Cafe des Artistes. I mean how could I take a job where I have to make something called Laverne and Curly Fries?
10633,So don't do it.
10634,How can I not do it? I have $127 in the bank.
10635,"Monica, relax, go get a beer."
10636,I don't want a beer.
10637,Who said it was for you?
10638,Hhhiiii.
10639,What's the matter with you?
10640,The mean guys at the coffee house took my hat.
10641,Noo.
10642,You're kiddin'.
10643,"It was ridiculous. Ya know, these guys, they were bullies, actual bullies, ya know. We're grown ups, this kinda stuff isn't supposed to happen anymore."
10644,Oohhh.
10647,"Ohhh  Oh no, wait a minute, I have no one."
10648,"Hey, woah, let's go down there and get your hat back."
10649,"Na, forget it, it's probably stripped and sold for parts by now."
10650,"Hey, I went up."
10652,"My stock, MEG, it went up 2 points. Hey guys, do you realize that if I had invested my $127 in myself yesterday that I'd like have...a lot more than that today. Ya know what, I'm gonna do it."
10653,Do what?
10654,Put all my money in me.
10655,"Monica, what are you talking about? You don't know the first thing about the stock market."
10656,"What's to know? Buy sell, high low, bears bulls... Yes Manhattan...yeah telephone number of the stock...selling store."
10657,"See, didn't I tell ya these pillows would be a good idea?"
10658,"Oh God, here we go. For the first time in my life I'm gonna say 'Hi birthfather'."
10659,"We love you, we're here for you."
10660,"Yeah good luck, good luck."
10662,"Hey Rach, you uh, you want some sandwich?"
10663,"Ohh, what is in that?"
10664,"Olive loaf and ham spread, no mayo."
10665,"No no, 'cause mayo, that would make it gross."
10666,"Hey, hey, no, oh oh."
10667,Run Phoebe run.
10668,"No no no, doggie please. Oh, I do so wanna love all animals, please no."
10669,"Get him a bone, get a bone. You gotta bone?"
10670,Are you kidding me?
10671,"Look kibbles, bits. Oh God, alright, get the hell off my leg you yippity piece of crap.  Ok, alright, we have a problem."
10672,Well why don't you just reach out and take his trampoline.
10673,"Ok, here, I know what we can do. "
10674,"Hey, hey, hey no."
10675,"Ok, doggie get the- aahhh. Ok go get the sandwich, get the sandwich doggie.  Good doggie get the sandwich, get the...ok, Joey, the dog will lick himself but he will not touch your sandwich, what does that say?"
10676,"Well if he's not gonna eat it, I will."
10677,Are you crazy?
10678,"Phoebs, he's just a little dog.  Ahhh."
10681,Do you have to be a Century 21 real-estate agent to get to wear those really cool jackets?
10682,Do you say this stuff to girls?
10683,"Hehehehey, isn't that the guy who used to wear your hat?"
10684,And look where they're sitting.
10685,"You're joking, right? You guys just walked through the door."
10686,Maybe we didn't make it clear enough.
10688,This couch belongs to us.
10689,"Alright, I'll tell you what, you call the couch and then, and then we'll call the couch, and we'll see who it comes to."
10690,You know what I keep wondering? Why you two are still sitting here.
10691,"Alright, that's it. I've had enough of this, alright. g*n, these guys are trying to take our seat."
10692,"Fellas, these guys were here first."
10693,"Oh, sorry, I didn't realize."
10696,Thank you g*n. We didn't want to have to go and do that.
10697,He told on us?
10698,You told on us?
10699,"Well pal, you didn't give me much of a choice. "
10700,Don't play with his things.
10702,"Alright, let's take this outside."
10703,"Let's, let's take this outside? Who talks like that?"
10704,The guy that's about to kick your ass talks like that.
10705,You had to ask.
10707,"Ok, ok look, see, the thing is we're, we're not gonna fight you guys."
10708,"Well then here's the deal, you won't have to so long as never ever show your faces in this coffee house ever again."
10709,I think you played the g*n card too soon.
10710,"Hey Phoeb's, I think you're good to go."
10711,"Yeah, I don't know."
10713,"I just think that this was a really bad sign, ya know. I mean, like the beast at the threshold, you know. It's just like, I have no family left, ya know. I mean except for my grandmother, you know, but let's face it, she's not gonna be around forever, despite what she says. And I have a sister who I've barely spoken to since we like shared a womb. I don't know, this is my real father and I just, I want things to be like just right."
10714,"Yeah Phoebe, I completely understand."
10715,"Yeah, whatever you need. Hey, you wanna go home?"
10716,"Ok, thanks. Sorry, again"
10718,"Uhh, I'm guessing the threshold's clear now."
10719,I wanna buy 5 shares of SGJ and I wanna buy them now. C'mon time is money my friend. Thank you. Wooo.
10720,Time is money my friend?
10721,"Yeah, you missed, 'Takes money to make money,' and uh, 'Don't make me come down there and kick your wall street butt.'"
10722,"Hey, I made $17 before breakfast, what have you done?"
10723,"Well uh, I had breakfast here so technically I saved $3.50."
10724,How did you make $17.
10725,"Well, my financially challenged friends, I split my money and I bought some shares of CHP and ZXY."
10726,How come those?
10727,"Well, CHP because I used to have a crush on Eric Estrada. And ZXY becuase I think it sounds zexy."
10728,"What happened to uh, MEG.?"
10729,"MEG was good for me but I dumped her. Ya know, my motto is get out before they go down."
10730,That is so not my motto.
10732,"Hey Phoebs. Oh hey, how's the dog?"
10733,"Ok, I talked to the vet, people are so nice upstate. Anyway, he said that the little fella's gonna be ok and I can pick him up tomorrow."
10736,"Yeah, but he did have to have a bunch of stitches and he said that only once in a blue moon does a dog's ear grow back so...still hoping."
10737,"Ok, so Phoebe, now are you gonna call your dad and let him know that his dog is ok?"
10738,"I, I don't wanna meet my father over the phone. What am I gonna say, like 'Hi, I'm Phoebe, the daughter you abandoned. Oh, by the way, I broke your dog.'"
10739,"Hey Phoebs, if you want, I'll do it."
10740,"Ok. Listen, just don't say anything about me, ok. "
10741,DON'T...be too long with the phone.
10742,She'll be a much better friend when the market closes.
10743,It's a woman.
10744,So talk to her.
10745,"Uhh, hello Miss Buffay. I know where your dog is. I want you to know that he'll be returned to you, almost as good as new, within, within 24 hours. Uh, goodbye. "
10746,Why the voice.
10747,Hard to say.
10748,Your cappucino sir.
10750,Ya know I think this is much better than the coffee house.
10752,How come it's not mixing with the water?
10753,"Hey, this is ridiculous. I'll tell you what. After I get back from my neice's christening, I'll go down to the coffee house with you and we'll all have a nice cup of coffee alright. No problem, Joey's there."
10757,"No. Man I don't wanna have to have Joey with me every time I wanna descent cup of coffee. Ya know, and I don't wanna spend the rest of my life drinking cappucino with a 'K'. I say you and I go back down there and stand up to those guys."
10758,"Alright, hang on a second there Custer."
10759,"Yeah really, Ross, have you ever been beaten up before?"
10761,By someone besides Monica?
10762,"No. So what. So what if we get beaten up, maybe that's just something every man has to go through once in his life. Ya know, like a, like a right of passage or somethin'."
10763,"Well, couldn't we just lose our virginities again? Ya know, because I think actually mine's growing back."
10764,I need to borrow a hundred bucks.
10766,"Hi, welcome home.  I need to borrow a hundred bucks."
10768,I've gotta get back in the game.
10769,"Why, when did you get out of the game?"
10770,"I don't know, I lost it all ok. I lost it."
10772,"Hey, I've come to terms with it, you have to too."
10773,"Ok. Look uhh, Mon I'm, I'm really sorry."
10774,"Yeah, yeah, yeah, where are we on the hundred bucks?"
10775,"I, I don't have it."
10776,"But I need it. Otherwords I'm gonna have to take that horrible diner job. You know, with the dancing and the costumes. I don't wanna have to wear flame retardant boobs."
10777,Nobody does honey.
10779,"Schnoodle. Oh my God, what the hell happened to my dog?"
10780,"It was an accident, and, and the woman who did this would never ever hurt a dog on purpose. She's a vegetarian."
10781,"What are these, stitches?"
10782,"Yeah, eight of them. That's 56 to him. You know also, if, if it's raining, you can't let him look up too long 'cause that cone'll fill up really really fast."
10783,"Yeah well, thanks for bringing back what's left of him."
10784,"Sure, oh, is, is Frank home."
10785,How do you know Frank?
10786,"Just from a, from a long time ago. Is he here?"
10787,Yeah. Frank.
10788,Yeah. What? 
10789,"Oh, ok, um, I mean Frank senior."
10790,He went out for groceries.
10791,Ok so will he be back soon?
10792,Well he left four years ago so we're expecting him back any minute now.
10793,"Alright, I'm, I'm gonna go. I'm sorry about the dog, everything. I'm sorry."
10794,Hey lady. Hey wait up. How do you know my dad?
10795,Um well I don't really. Just genetically. He's kinda my dad too.
10796,Heavy.
10797,"Yeah. So um, did he ever talk about me, Phoebe?"
10798,No but he didn't really talk about anything.
10800,Except stilts.
10801,Stilts?
10802,"Yeah, he loved stilts. One time I was upstairs, I was stealing cigarettes out of my mom's purse, and uh, all of a sudden I look over and there's my dad's head bobbing past the window. He just had this big smile on his face and he was waving 'cause he was always happiest when he was on his stilts."
10805,I don't know what to do with that.
10806,Me neither. So you're like my big sister.
10808,"This is huge, you can buy me beer."
10809,"I'm not gonna. But you know what's cool though? Ok, if you had a friend named Pete, then I could say, 'Oh yeah, I know Pete, he's friends with my brother.'"
10810,I gotta friend named Mark.
10811,That'll work too.
10812,"Cool, alright. So maybe, ya know, I could give you a call sometime, we could talk or somethin'."
10813,"Yeah, that'd be ok."
10815,"Ok, I'm in the book."
10816,"Ok, yeah."
10817,"Alright. So um, stilts huh?"
10818,"Yeah hey, you know if you want I can take you around back and show you where he hit his head on the rain gutter."
10820,"Well we did it, we're here. We are standing our ground. How long does a cup of coffee take?"
10821,Would you come on! Come on!  Thank you.
10822,"Ah, there we go."
10823,I think we proved our point.
10824,You burn your mouth?
10825,Cannot feel my tounge.
10826,"Bullies, big bullies."
10827,"Oh, look who's here, it's the weenies."
10828,Did we not make ourselves clear the other day.
10829,"Yes, and that's why we're here."
10830,"Yes, we're standing out ground...apparently."
10831,Let's do this alright.
10832,"Woah, ho-ho, whad'ya got there, a w*apon?"
10833,"It's a nice watch, I don't wanna break it on your ribs."
10834,"Alright, let's do this."
10836,"Question. If I don't care about my watch, can I use it as a w*apon?"
10837,Whad'ya mean?
10838,"Well, it's sharp, it's metal, I think I can do some, you know, serious damage with it."
10839,"No, you can't use your watch."
10841,Or your keys.
10843,"Look, here's what we'll do. We'll put all keys and watches in the hat over there. Alright.  Alright, c'mon man, let's do this."
10844,"Before I forget, are we hitting faces?"
10845,"Of course we're hitting faces, why wouldn't you hit faces?"
10846,"Well because I have to work on Monday, I have a big presentation."
10847,"Actually, you know, uh, I gotta show this apartment tomorrow and uh, you know, this no faces thing might not be a bad idea."
10848,"Ok, nothing from the neck up.  Or the waist down. Dana's ovulating."
10849,"Oh really, you guys tryin' again?"
10851,"Ok, so let me just get this straight. So we're uh, strictly talking about the middle?"
10852,C'MON!
10853,"Hey, hey, woah, you want some of this, huh? You want a piece of this, huh? I'm standin here, huh."
10854,"Hey, hey, those guys are takin our stuff! "
10857,"God, that was, that was amazing, that was incredible. You guys, you guys kicked butt."
10858,"Us, what about you guys? Man you really, bing, gave it to old Mr. Clean back there. He was a big guy."
10859,Yeah he was wasn't he.
10860,"Yeah, I wouldn't know having missed everything."
10861,Don't do that to yourself. Any one of us could have tripped over that little girls jump-rope.
10862,"So, listen guys, are we uh, are we ok here?"
10863,We're ok.
10865,"Ok so, can I have my hat back?"
10868,Look at her.
10869,Hi Monica.
10870,"He-he-he, how's it goin'?"
10871,Hey nice boobs.
10872,"Guys guys, check this out."
10874,"So, I'll get candles and my mom's lace tablecloth, and since it's Rachel's birthday, I mean, we want it to be special, I thought I'd poach a salmon."
10877,Question. Why do we always have to have parties where you poach things?
10878,You wanna be in charge of the food committee?
10879,Question two. Why do we always have to have parties with committees?
10880,Really. Why can't we just get some pizzas and get some beers and have fun?
10882,"Yeah, I agree. Ya know, I think fancy parties are only fun if you're fancy on the inside and I'm just not sure we are."
10883,"Alright. If you guys don't want it to be special, fine. You can throw any kind of party you want."
10884,"Joey they're not real. I start miles beneath the surface of these things, ok, they're fake. See  honk honk."
10885,"Wow, it's, it's like p*rn for clowns."
10886,"I talked to Rachel's sisters, neither of them can come."
10887,"Ok, um so, I still have to invite Dillon and Emma and Shannon Cooper."
10888,"Woah, woah, woah, uh, no Shannon Cooper."
10889,Why not her?
10890,"Cause she uh, she steals stuff."
10891,Or maybe she doesn't steal stuff and Joey just slept with her and never called her back.
10892,Joey that is horriable.
10893,"Hey I liked her, alright. Maybe, maybe too much. I don't know I guess I just got scared."
10894,"I'm sorry, I didn't know."
10895,"I didn't think anyone'd buy that, ok."
10896,"Hi honey, how did it go?"
10897,"Agh, it was the graduation from hell."
10898,"Ya know, my cousin went to hell on a football scholarship."
10899,"Ya know, I mean this is supposed to be a joyous occasion. My sister's graduating from college, nobody thought she would. It's a true testament to what a girl from long island would do for a Celica."
10901,"My parents happened. All they had to do was sit in the same stadium, smile proudly, and not talk about the divorce. But nooo, they got into a huge fight in the middle of the commencement address. Bishop Tutu actually had to stop and shush them. But you know what, you know what the good news is? I get to serve coffee for the next 8 hours."
10902,"Ok, so I guess we don't invite her parents."
10903,"Well, how bout just her mom?"
10904,Why her mom?
10905,Cause I already invited her.
10906,"Ooh, ooh, did you ask Stacy Roth?"
10907,"Oh no, can't invite her. She also steals."
10908,"Ok, here are the birthday candles. Where's the birthday cake?"
10909,"Ok, we're not having birthday cake, we're having birthday flan."
10911,It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert.
10912,"Oh that's nice. Happy birthday Rachel, here's some goo."
10913,Dr. Greene. Oh my God it's Rachel's dad. What're you doing here?
10914,What? The father can't drop by to see the daughter on her birthday?
10915,"No no, the father can, but um, since I am the roommate I can tell you that she's not here and I'll pass along the message, ok. So bye-bye."
10916,"Ohhh, you're having a parteee."
10917,"No, no, not a party. Just a surprise gathering of some people Rachel knows. Um, this is Phoebe and Chandler and Joey."
10918,"I'll never remember all of that. So uh, what's the deal? Rachel comes home, people pop out and yell stuff, is that it?"
10919,"This isn't your first surprise party, is it sir?"
10921,Chinese menu guy. Forgot the menus.
10922,"So, basically just a Chinese guy."
10923,"Uh, hey, Dr. Greene, why don't you come with me, we'll put your jacket on Rachel's bed."
10924,"Alright, that sounds like a two person job. "
10925,"Well, my goodness, what was that?"
10926,"Sandra, I am so sorry, I thought you were Rachel and we just weren't ready for you yet."
10927,You thought I was Rachel?
10928,"Yes because uh, you look so young."
10929,"And because you're both, you know, white women."
10930,"Oh, I missed you kids. Well, should I put my coat in the bedroom?"
10931,"NO! No, I'll take that for ya."
10932,"Oh well thank you. Such a gentleman. Thank you.  Ahh, it all looks so nice, so festive, all the balloons...  The funniest thing happened to me on the way here. I was..."
10933,"Ha-ha, that's great, ha-ha. I can't wait to hear the rest of it, ya know, but I really have to go to the bathroom so... Hey, come with me. Yeah, yeah, it'll be like we're gal pals, ya know, like at a restraunt. Oh, it'll be fun, c'mon. "
10935,"Ok, think, what would Jack and Chrissy do?"
10936,"Ok, now that your coat is safely in the bedr-,  oh, ok we can come back out in the living room."
10937,"So uh, Joey and Chanlder, I, I think it's time that you take Dr. Greene over to your place."
10938,"Uhh, yes, absdolutely, um. Why again?"
10939,Because that's where the party is you goon. See this is just the staging area.
10940,Right this is staging.
10941,"Yeah, this more than anything else, is the staging area."
10942,This is clearly in the wrong apartment. 
10943,"Alright you guys are off to party number one  and you, you are off to party number two  Alright fellas, let's keep it movin', let' keep it movin."
10944,Chandler could you at least send some women to my party?  Alright that's Ross.
10945,"Ok, they're coming, shhh. "
10946,"Ohh, thank you for the wonderful dinner."
10947,Thanks for being born.
10948,"Ohh, thank you for my beautiul earrings, they're perfect. I love you."
10949,"Oh, now you can exchange them if you want, ok."
10950,Now I love you even more.
10951,Surprise.
10952,"Oh my gosh, wow. Monica. Oh my god. Mom. This is so great."
10953,Happy birthday sweetie.
10954,"Wow you, you. I had no idea."
10956,"No, I knew."
10958,"Ok, everybody, there's food and drinks on the table. Go across the hall."
10961,"Right now, Joey and Chandler's, go now."
10962,Why.
10963,Just go.
10965,Happy birthday sweetpea.
10966,Daddy.
10967,"Both of them are here, both of them, both of them are here?"
10968,"Well, we could count again."
10969,I can't believe this is happening.
10970,"You know what, this is ridiculous, ok. This is your birthday, this is your party. I say we just put 'em all together and if they can't deal with it, who cares."
10972,That's who.
10973,"Look, are you gonna be ok?"
10974,"Well, I have to be, I don't really have a choice, I mean, you know, I could look at the bright side, I get two birthday parties and two birthday cakes."
10975,"Well, actually just one birthday flan."
10977,"It's a traditional Mexican custard dessert...Look talk to Monica, she's on the food committee."
10978,"Joey, Joey. Hey, some girl just walked up to me and said, 'I want you Dennis,' and stuck her tounge down my throat. I love this party."
10979,Quick volleyball question.
10980,Volleyball.
10981,"Yeah, we set up a court in your room. Uh, you didn't really like that grey lamp, did you?"
10982,"Joey, a woman just stuck her tounge down my throat, I'm not even listening to you."
10983,Dennis.
10984,"Ok, that's me. "
10985,"Listen honey, can you keep dad occupied, I'm gonna go talk to mom for a while."
10986,"Ok, do you have any ideas for any openers?"
10987,"Uhh, let's just stay clear of 'I'm the guy that's doing you daughter' and you should be ok."
10988,"Ok people, I want you to take a piece of paper, here you go, and write down your most embarassing memory. Oh, and I do ask that when you're not using the markers, you put the caps back on them because they will dry out."
10989,"Hi Dr. Greene. So, uh, how's everything in the uh, vascular surgery....game?"
10990,"It's not a game Ross, a woman d*ed on my table today."
10991,I'm sorry. See that's the good thing about my job. All the dinosaurs on my table are already dead.
10992,"Listen you guys, I don't mean to be a pain about this but, um, I've noticed that some of you are just placing them on. You wanna push the caps until you hear them click.  g*n, where're you going?"
10993,"I um, was sorta thinking about maybe..."
10994,"No. No you can't go. No this is fun. Come on we're just getting started. Here, here's your marker."
10995,"Listen if you wanna go, just go."
10996,"No, she'll yell at me again."
10997,"Alright, I can get you out."
10999,"Shh. In a minute, I'm gonna create a diversion. When I do, walk quickly to the door and don't look back."
11000,I think I need a drink.
11001,"Oh, here, I, I'll get it for ya. Whad'ya want?"
11002,Scotch.
11003,"Scotch. Alright, I'll be back in 10 seconds with your scotch on the rocks in a glass."
11004,Neat.
11006,"No no no, no no no, neat, as in no rocks."
11008,"Oh hello Ross, where have you been?"
11009,"Hi. Uh, I have been in the bathroom. Stay clear of the salmon mousse."
11010,"Oh, scotch neat. Ya know, that's Rachel's father's drink."
11011,"Oh, mine too. Isn't that neat, scotch neat. Would you excuse me?  Hey, hey, where you uh, sneakin off to mister?"
11012,I'm getting my cigarettes out of my jacket.
11013,No. no.
11014,Whad'ya mean no?
11015,"No, um, see 'cause that, that is, that is the staging area. If you go in there, it'll ruin the whole illusion of the party. Yeah, I think you take your scotch back in there and I will get your cigarettes for you sir."
11016,Get my glasses too.
11017,All righty roo.  What a great moment to say that for the first time. 
11018,"Ok, the first person's most embarassing memory is, 'Monica, your party sucks.' Very funny."
11019,"Oh no, ooh, ooh, did somebody forget to use a coaster?"
11020,What?  I don't see anything.
11021,"Great, I'm seeing water rings again."
11022,"Ross, whose glasses are those?"
11023,Mine.
11024,You wear bi-focals?
11025,"Um-hmm.  I have a condition, apparently, that I require two different sets of focals."
11026,Did you know my husband has glasses just like that?
11027,Well those are very popular frames.
11028,Neil Sedaka wears them.
11029,I hear you can get people out of here.
11030,"Rachel, you didn't tell me your boyfriend smoked."
11031,"Yeah, like a chimney."
11032,"Ohh, big smoker.  Big big smoker. In fact I'm gonna go ou into the hallway and fire up this bad boy. "
11033,Are you wearing my glasses?
11034,Yes.  I was just warming up the earpieces for you.
11035,Thank you. Is that one of my cigarettes?
11036,"Yeah, yes it is, I was just moistening the tip."
11037,"Ok, ok, she's taking the trash out so I can get you out of here but it has to be now, she'll be back any minute."
11038,What about my friend Victor?
11039,"No, only the three of you, any more than that and she'll get suspicious."
11040,"Alright, let me just get my coat."
11041,There isn't time. You must leave everything. They'll take care of you next door.
11042,Is it true they have beer?
11043,Everything you've heard is true.
11044,"Could you guys please try to keep it down, we're trying to start a Boggle tournament."
11045,"You, and you, you're supposed to be at my party. And g*n! What are you doing here?"
11046,Um 
11047,"Ok, welcome to the fu-oh."
11048,Phoebe.
11049,"Alright, I'm sorry but these people needed me. They work hard all week, it's Saturday night, they deserve to have a little fun. Go."
11050,"Ya know, my party is fun. I mean, maybe it's a little quieter, less obvious sorta fun but, you know, if people would just give it a chance... "
11051,You want me to see a therapist?
11052,"Sweetheart, you obviously have a problem. You've chosen a boyfriend exactly like your father."
11053,"Ok mom, you know what, fine, I'll make an appointment ok, but you know what, right now, I gotta go, I gotta go do a thing."
11054,Did you know your mother spent $1200 dollars on bansai trees. I felt like Gulliver around that place.
11055,"Daddy, daddy, you know what, I really wanna hear more about this, I really do, but I just have, I just have to do a, some stuff."
11056,You work and you work and you work at a marriage but all he cares about is his stupid boat.
11057,You work and you work and you work on a boat...
11058,He always ridiculed my pottery classs...
11059,...and you sand it and you varnish it...
11060,"...but when all is said and done, he still drinks out of the mugs."
11061,...and her yoga and her Bridges of Madison County...
11062,...the scotch and the cigarettes...
11063,...and the bansai's and the chiuaua...
11064,...I may have only been in therapy for three weeks now dear but...
11065,...what the hell does she want with half a boat...
11066,"Ok, ok, you can be shirts and I'll be skins. I'll be skins.  Hey, how you holdin' up there, tiger? Oh, sorry, when my parents were getting divorced I got a lot of tigers. Got a lot of champs, chiefs, sports, I even got a governor."
11067,"This is it, isn't it? I mean, this is what my life is gonna be like. My mom there, my dad there. Thanksgiving, Christmas. She gets the house, he's in some condo my sister's gonna decorate with wicker. Oh, Chandler how did you get through this?"
11068,"Well, I relied on a carefully regimented program of denial and, and wetting the bed."
11069,"Ya know, I just, so weird. I mean I was in there just listening to them bitch about each other and all I kept thinking about was the fourth of July."
11070,Becasue it reminded you of the way our forefathers used to bitch at each other?
11071,"It's just this thing. Every year we would go out on my dad's boat and watch the fireworks. Mom always hated it because the ocean air made her hair all big. My sister Jill would be throwing up over the side and my dad would be upset becasue nobody was helping and then when we did help he would scream at us for doing it wrong. But then when the fireworks started, everybody just shut up, you know, and it'd get really cold, and we would all just sort of smush under this one blanket. It never occured to anybody to bring another one. And now it's just..."
11072,"I, I know. "
11073,"Ok, thanks for coming, I hope you guys had fun."
11074,"Alright, Monica dear, I'm gonna hit the road. Now I've left my 10 verbs on the table. And you be sure and send me that finished poem."
11075,Ok will do. So glad you came.
11076,I think I saw Rachel out in the hall.
11077,"Ok, let me go check. Your mom want's to say goodbye."
11078,Oh ok.
11081,"Ahh, you drive safe."
11082,"Ross, what're you doing."
11083,I'm getting ready for the water skiing.  How are you doing?
11084,"Well, uh, Dr. Greene, where are you going?"
11085,To get my coat.
11086,No no no.
11087,"Sorry, we're on a major flan high."
11088,"Oh no, you're not supposed to be here. This is the staging area, you should, it's all wrong, you should leave, ya know, get out.  Or perhaps you'd like a creme d'menthe."
11089,"I have to be heading to my chateau, thank you."
11090,"Oh all right, then I guess we're going back into the hallway."
11091,"Thanks for coming Mrs. Greene.  Well, ok, you take care."
11092,"Oh, you kids  Well, this is the best party I've been to in years."
11094,"Ok everybody, it's time for flan."
11095,"Yup, get ready for the gelatenous fun."
11096,Kinda looks like that stuff you get when you get a bad infection.
11097,"Ok, that's enough."
11098,"Ok Rachel, make a special flan wish."
11099,"Ok, I've got one.  Wow, those things almost never come true."
11100,"Ok, Chandler, Mon, there's only one bananna nut muffin left."
11101,"Oh, I ordered mine first."
11102,"Yeah, but I'm, I'm so much faster..."
11103,Give it to me.
11106,"Ok, you can have it. "
11107,"There you go, enjoy your coffee."
11108,That was there when I got here. 
11109,"Hey you guys, you will never guess who's coming to New York."
11110,"Quick, Phoebe, tell us before he can swallow."
11111,"Oh ok, Ryan, that guy I went out with, who's in the Navy."
11112,You went out with a guy in the Navy?
11113,"Yeah, I met him when I was playing guitar in Washington Square Park. Ryan threw in salt water taffy 'cause he didn't have any change."
11114,"Hey, is that when you wrote salt water taffy man?"
11115,"No. No, he is my submaring guy. He resurfaces like every couple years and we have the most amazing three days together. Only this time he's coming for two weeks. Two whole weeks, which means yay."
11116,"So wait, this guy goes down for like two years at a time?"
11117,That'll teach you to lick my muffin.
11118,Hiii.
11119,"Oh no, what happened?"
11120,"Well, I just spoke to Carol. Ben's got the chicken pox."
11122,"Yeah, so if you haven't already had it, chances are you're gonna get it."
11123,Well I've had it.
11124,"Yeah, I've had it."
11125,Had it.
11127,"Well, I've never had it, I feel so left out.  Oh look!"
11128,"Honey, you made the bed again. I told you, you don't have to do that. This isn't camp."
11129,"Ooh, then I guess the panty raid last night was totally uncalled for. Ok, I am going to take a shower and today I will be singing Jim Crochee's Leroy Brown."
11130,"Monica...  Hey Mon, I have a question. Is Leroy the baddest man in the whole damn town or the fattest man in the whole damn town?"
11131,Baddest. Otherwise the song would be Fat Fat Leroy Brown.
11133,Just waiting for you sweetie.
11134,Are you remaking the bed?
11135,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. You know what, the way you did it was just fine."
11136,"Then, you're redoing it because..."
11137,"If I tell you, you'll think I'm crazy."
11138,You're pretty much running that risk either way.
11139,"Ok, you see, the tag shouldn't be at the top left corner, it should be at the bottom right corner."
11140,"Oh, well that's not so crazy."
11141,I'm just easing you in.
11142,"Oh, alright."
11143,"Alright, you see these little flower blossoms? They should be facing up, not down, because, well, the head of the bed is where the sun would be. You don't love me any more do you."
11144,"Actually, if it's possible, I love you more."
11145,"Really? Wow, well then come on, I wanna show you how to fold the toilet paper into a point."
11146,"Hey, look Joey, I'm just saying if you need something to hold you over, I can get you a job right here as an entry level processor."
11147,But don't you need experience for a job like that?
11148,"It's not that hard to learn. And as for people realizing you have no idea what you're doing, hey, you're an actor. Act like a processor, people will think you're a processor."
11149,"Hey Chandler, here's this morning's projections."
11150,"Hey thanks. Scott Alexander, Joey Tribbianni. Joey is a uh, fellow processor."
11151,No kidding.
11152,"Oh yeah yeah. I process. People want the processing, I'm the one they call."
11153,Where do you work?
11154,"Uhh, well, right now I'm in between things. You know how it is. One day you're processing, the next day you're not so much... processing any more."
11155,I was just telling Joey about the opening in Fleischman's group.
11156,"Fleischman's group. Whatever you do, don't touch his sandwiches. Ha-ha-ha..."
11157,Ha-ha.  Are all you processors dorks?
11158,"Oh, this lipstick looks just great on you."
11159,"You look fabulous honey, you really do."
11160,"Yeah? Are you sure, really. "
11161,"You see, you look beautiful. For god sakes, dim the lights."
11162,"I, I, I'm hideous."
11163,It's gonna be ok. Ryan's been under water. He's just gonna be so glad that you don't have barnicles on your butt.
11164,Come in.
11165,"Hey baby, I'm back... "
11166,"Hey Ryan, what's up?"
11168,"Well, no no, you have to stay back. I, I have the pox."
11169,Chicken or small?
11170,Chicken. Which is so ironic considering I'm a vegetarian.
11171,Why aren't you at home in bed?
11172,"'Cause my, my grandmother's never had chicken pox. Please, please tell me you have, 'cause oh my God, I forgot how cute you are."
11173,"I'm sorry, I never had 'em."
11175,"If I had one wish, it would be to build a time machine, go back to when I was 7, when Jimmy Hauser had the chicken pox. I would grab that kid and rub him all over my face."
11176,"Yeah, or you know, you could just wish that I didn't have them now."
11177,Can I please see your face?
11178,Nope. You don't want to see a face covered with pox.
11179,"Your face could be covered with lochs, I wouldn't care."
11180,"And you hate fish. Oh. That's so sweet, alright. Ok, alright, you can see. This is me...  Oh, I am scary."
11181,"Sorry, the lightning. Lightning was an unfortunate incidence. You look lovely, lovely."
11182,"I hate this. 'Cause I tell you, I had the most amazing two weeks planned for us, and almost everything I had in mind, we had to be a lot closer than this."
11183,"Phoebe, I have spent the last eight months in a steel tube with men, thinking about this moment. I am not gonna let a bunch of itchy spots stand between us. "
11184,"Ok, this is the most romantic disease I've ever had."
11186,"Hey, how's the first day goin'?"
11187,Pretty good. It's like you said. It's mostly just putting numbers from one column into another column.
11188,Well there you go.
11189,"Hey and everbody is so nice. I just had a good talk with that lady with the red hair, Jeannie."
11190,"Jeannie, the head of east coast operations Jeannie?"
11191,"Yeah, turns out our kids go to the same school. Small world huh?"
11192,Weird world. Your kids?
11193,I figure my character has kids.
11194,Ya know there isn't a part of that sentence I don't need explained.
11195,"Well, see when you're acting you need to think about stuff like that. My character, Joseph the processor guy, has two little girls, Ashley and Brittany. Ashley copies everything Brittany does."
11196,"Well, invisible kids can be that way sometimes."
11197,"Yeah. Joseph and his wife, Karen, are thinking of having a third kid... Ya know what? Just did."
11198,Really? Wow. That's some pretty powerful imaginary sperm you must have there.
11199,You know what makes the itching even worse?
11200,That you don't stop talking about it.
11202,"Let's just play, ok. Good, ok.  Here we go, double sixes, here we go...  Here we go, come to mama, just getting ready to roll the dice..."
11203,What're you doing? Are you scratching?
11204,"No. This is what I do for luck, ok."
11205,You're scratching. Give me the dice.
11207,Give me the dice.
11208,"No. Here.  There. Ooh, double sixes."
11209,"We can't scratch. You know we can't, we'll scar."
11210,"Uhh, I can't stop thinking about it. It's just so hard. I just wanna grab all these houses and rub 'em all over my body. "
11212,Give it.
11214,"Yeah, come on. You know you want it, you know you want it too, come on. Let's just be bad, it'll feel so good. "
11215,Oh God help me.
11216,"Now do me, do my back. Oh come on, harder."
11217,"Oh, stop that, stop that right now."
11218,"You know, I might have expected this of you Phoebe, but Ryan, you're a m*llitary man."
11219,"You and Milton have to join us on the boat. Karen'll pack a lunch, you'll bring the kids, we'll make a day of it."
11220,"Oh, that sounds lovely. We're gonna have to set that up. Oh, I better get back. Hope the baby feels better."
11221,"Oh, thanks, thanks. Bye bye Jeannie."
11222,Bye bye Joey.
11223,What a phony.
11224,"Well, I'm sure you'll teach her a lesson when she steps off the dock onto nothing. Hey Mr. Douglas."
11225,Sir.
11226,"Uh, listen Bing, I received your memo. So, we're not gonna receive the systems report until next Friday?"
11227,Well the people in my group wanna spend the holiday weekend with their families.
11228,"I have a family, I'm gonna be here."
11229,"Yeah Bing, what's that about?"
11230,"It's about cutting my people a little slack, ya know, for morale. Look, if you wanna see some rough numbers, I can get them to you by Wednesday."
11231,Rough numbers?
11232,This company was not built on rough numbers. Am I right Mr. Douglas.
11233,Have the final numbers on my desk by Tuesday.
11234,"Uh, if you say so sir."
11235,"Joseph's good, isn't he?"
11236,"Well, I'm going to k*ll you."
11237,"Hey, hey, I just figure Joseph's the kinda guy that likes to mix it up. Ya know, get in there, ruffle some feathers."
11239,"Look, I'm sorry but that's what Joseph does, ok. If you try to pull somethin', he'll call you on it. 'What're you tryin' to pull,' he'll say."
11240,"Ooh, duct tape. Was I supposed to bring something too?"
11241,This is for the scratchy twins out there. I taped oven mits to their hands.
11242,You're strict.
11243,It's for their own good.
11244,"You know, I like the way you have efficiently folded this tab under. See in a tape emergency you could shave valuable seconds off your time."
11245,"Exactly. Oh, I love that I can be totally neurotic around you now. Tell me the truth. Don't you like it better now that everything on your desk is perpendicular?"
11246,"If it's not a right angle, it is a wrong angle."
11247,Very good.
11249,You know what. Tomorrow I'm gonna do your clocks.
11250,You're gonna do what to my clocks.
11251,I'm gonna set them to my time.
11252,"Well, I'm confused. I thought we shared time."
11253,"No no. See, in my bedroom I set my clock six minutes fast. You wanna know why?"
11254,Because it's in a slightly different time zone than the kitchen.
11255,"No forget it, I'm not gonna tell you now."
11256,No come on. Come on tell me.
11257,No. See you don't understand.
11259,No. You don't have any of these cute little obsessive things.
11260,No that's not true. That is not true.
11263,"Alright, well tell me one of yours."
11264,"Ok. Ahh. One of my things is, I always separate my sweat socks from my dress socks."
11265,What if they get mixed up?
11266,"Boy I would just uh, I would freak out."
11267,"You would not. I can't believe this. I hate this, you're too normal. I can't believe my boyfriend doesn't have a thing. My boyfriend doesn't have a thing."
11268,"See, if anyone overheard that, I didn't come off well."
11269,Hey. Mr. Douglas is looking for you.
11270,Why? Wh- wh- why is Mr. Douglas looking for me?
11271,'Cause he has a strong suspicion that you dropped the ball on the Lender project.
11272,"Wha- wh- why, why, why does he suspect that?"
11273,"Becasue at first he thought it was Joseph. But after he asked Joseph about it, turns out it was you. Anyway, I just thought you should know."
11274,"Alright, that's it. Look Joey, I'm sorry, I realize this is the role of a lifetime for ya, and if I could just fire Joseph, I would, but unfortunately that's not possible so I'm gonna have to let both of you go."
11275,"What're you talking about, everybody loves Joseph."
11276,"I don't, I hate Joseph, ok. I think he's a brown-nosing suck up."
11277,"Oh yeah. Well you can't fire Joseph. You know why, 'cause he's not in your department."
11278,"Alright, ok, alright. So I can't fire Joseph but uh, I can sleep with his wife."
11279,Karen.
11280,"Yeah, Karen. I'm thinking about having an affair with her. Oh, you know what? I just did."
11281,Ahh. What the hell are you doing to me man.
11282,"Oh well it's not me, it's my character, Chandy. Yeah the rogue processor who seduces his co-worker's wives for sport and then laughs about it the next day at the water cooler. In fact, I have her panties right there in my drawer."
11284,"No freakshow, she's fictional."
11285,"Take it easy. If it means that much to you, I'll uh, I'll go find something else."
11287,"It's just that, I, I'm gonna miss Joseph. I liked him. His wife, she was hot. "
11288,Can I please take these off? I swear I won't scratch.
11289,"No sorry hon, Monica's orders."
11290,Well that wasn't easy.
11291,"Ok, dinner's on."
11292,And there's a peach cobbler warming in the oven so the plate's gonna be hot but that shouldn't be a problem for you.
11293,"Alright you kids, bye now."
11294,Bye. 
11295,"Oh look, a low budget puppet show."
11296,It's such a shame you can't see which finger I'm holding up.
11297,Wine?
11298,Please. 
11299,"Oh, I spilled some."
11300,I got it. 
11301,"I must tell you, you look beautiful tonight."
11303,Sorry. You look beautiful.
11305,"You know what, that's it, that's it. "
11306,"Monica, wake up. Monica."
11308,I thought of a thing.
11310,"Yeah. I have to sleep, have to, on this side of the bed."
11311,No honey. You have to sleep on this side of the bed because I have to sleep on this side of the bed.
11312,Or so I would have you believe.
11313,"No. Big deal, so you have a side of the bed, everybody has a side of the bed."
11314,"Hey come on, you haven't heard my reason yet."
11315,"Alright, go on."
11316,"Ok, I have to sleep on the west side because I grew up in California and otherwise the ocean would be on the wrong side."
11317,"Oh my God, you're a freak."
11318,Yeah. How 'bout that.
11319,"So uh, Ryan, were you shipping off to?"
11320,I really can't say.
11321,So do you have like any nuclear w*apon on board?
11322,I can't say.
11323,"Well do you get to look through one of those like, those periscope thingys."
11324,"I'm sorry, but I can't say."
11325,"Wow, it, it's neat learning about submarines."
11326,"I better get out of here, I'm gonna miss my flight."
11327,"Ok, I'll walk you out."
11328,Bye Ryan.
11329,Pleasure.
11330,It was nice to meet you.
11332,"So do you uh, think we can get you one of those uh, uniform things?"
11333,You like that do ya?
11335,I'll make some calls. 
11337,Can you believe how we spent our two weeks together?
11338,"I know. We didn't do any of the romantic things I had planned, like having a picnic at Central Park and ya know, coffee at Central Perk. Oh I just got that. "
11339,Taxi.
11340,Bye you. 
11341,"Oh I'm sorry, we're clo-... Hey sailor."
11342,Is this what you had in mind?
11343,I'll say.
11344,I'm shipping out tomorrow.
11345,"Well then uh, we better make this night count.  Oh wait, I forgot to turn off the cappucino machine.  Anchors away. Oh no no, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my purse, my pu rse.  Oh, you know what. I forgot to turn off the bathroom light."
11346,"Alright you know, why don't I just meet you upstairs. "
11347,"Hey Joey, how'd the audition go?"
11348,Incredible! I met the director this time and you'll never believe who it was.
11350,All right. I'll give you one hint. Warren Beatty.
11352,"Yeah, there's just one thing that might be kind've a problem. See, I, uh, had to kiss this guy."
11353,'Cause he was just so darn cute.
11354,"No, as part of the audition. See, I'm up for this part of this guy, who the main guy kisses."
11355,"Well, hey. You're an actor, I say you just suck it up and do it.  Or you just do it."
11356,"I did do it, I'm a professional."
11357,Then what's the problem?
11358,"See after the scene, Mr. Beatty comes up to me and says 'good actor, bad kisser'. Can you believe that, me not a good kisser, that's like, like Mother Theresa, not a good mother. "
11359,"Well, come on, who cares what that guy thinks. What does Warren Beatty know about kissing  Ooh."
11360,"Hey, what did your agent say?"
11361,"Yep, this kiss thing is defiantly a problem, Mr. Beatty wants to see it again on Monday. Man, I gotta figure out what I'm doing wrong. Oh, okay, one of you girls come over here and kiss me."
11362,"What, forget it!"
11364,"Come on, I need your help here."
11365,"All right. I'll do it, I kissed him before I can do it again."
11366,"You see this, this is a friend."
11367,"Uh-huh, let's go.  Oh, wait I have gum. Okay.  Good, very good, firm but tender. I'd recommend you to a friend."
11368,Then I don't know what it is. What's the problem?
11369,"Joey, you know, maybe your just not used to kissing men, maybe you just tensed up a little, maybe that's what you need to work on."
11370,"Yeah, that makes sense. "
11371,Over my dead body! 
11372,And I'll be using his dead body as a shield.
11373,"Come on out, honey! I'm telling you look good!  Tell her she looks good, tell her she looks good."
11374,"Oh my God, you look so good!"
11375,I can not believe I have to walk down the aisle in front of 200 people looking like something you drink when your nauseous.
11376,"So don't, I don't see why we have to go to this thing anyway, it's your ex-fiancee's wedding."
11377,Because I promised Mindy I would.
11378,"Yeah, well you promised Barry, you'd marry him. "
11379,"Look you guys, I have to go, I'm the Maid-of-Honor. And besides you know what I just need to be in a room again with these people and feel good about myself."
11380,Ooh-oh! Someone's wearing the same clothes they had on last night. Someone get a little action?
11381,I may have.
11382,"Woo-hoo, stuud!"
11383,What's she look like?
11384,"Well, we haven't exactly met, we just stayed up all night talking on the internet."
11385,"Woo-hoo, geeek!"
11386,"I like this girl, okay, I seriously like this girl, you now how sometimes I tend get a little defended and quipy..."
11387,Get out!
11389,Please!
11390,"Well she totally called me on it, okay. She said, 'cut it out, get real', and I did."
11391,Wow! What's that like?
11392,"It's like this, me, no jokes."
11393,"All right, stop it, you're freaking me out."
11394,"Oh, yeah, I don't like you this way. All right, I'll see you guys later."
11395,"Bye, Richard."
11396,"Bye sweetie,  I love you."
11397,"I love you, too."
11398,"I think my boyfriend ever so dreamy, I wonder what our wedding's gonna be like."
11399,What are you talking about? What wedding?
11400,"Come on, like you never talk that."
11401,"Nooo! Never! I mean, we're living in the moment. God, it is so nice for once to not have to get all hung up on 'Where is this going?'"
11402,Afraid to ask him?
11403,Could not be more terrified.
11404,"Well, I think you should seriously consider the marriage thing, give Rachel another chance to dress up like Princess Bubble Yum."
11405,"Where's Benny?  There he is!  Where's Benny, there he is."
11406,"Awww! You know that's probably why babies learn to talk, so they can tell grown ups to cut it out."
11407,"Hey, you know I got a question for ya. Just a little thing, no pressure. "
11409,"Did you ever, uh, like, think about the future?"
11410,Sure I do.
11411,"Yeah, am I in it?"
11412,"Honey, you are in it."
11413,"Oh God, you are about to get sooo lucky."
11415,Keep talkin'.
11416,"Well, uh, sometimes I think about selling my practice, we could move to France, make French toast."
11417,"Okay, so, uh, we're in France, we're making the toast. Do you see a little bassinet in the corner?"
11418,Like a hound?
11419,"Not a basset, a bassinet."
11420,You really need the bassinet?
11421,"Well, I just think the baby would keep falling off the dog. Do you, uh, do you , do you not see kids in our future."
11422,"Oh, hey. I love children, I have children. I just don't want to be 70 when our kids go off to college, and our lives can finally start."
11424,"Look I want you, now."
11425,"That's Great. You know we don't need to talk about this now. Really, I mean this is, is so way, way, way, in the future, I'm talkin' hovercrafts and apes taking over the planet."
11426,"Come on, Chandler, I want this part soo much.  Just one kiss, I won't tell anyone."
11427,"Joey, no means no!"
11429,"I'm sorry we, we don't have your sheep."
11430,"Aww, Rach, I think you look cute  And you, uh, you, you I could eat with a spoon ."
11431,Get away from me I said no!
11432,Richard buzzed. He's waiting downstairs.
11433,"Oh, Richard's here. I should run down say bye to him "
11435,"Bye, good luck."
11436,"So how's your date with your cyberchick going. Ooh, hey, what is all that ."
11437,"Oh, it's a website, it's the, uh, the Guggenheim  museum. See, she likes art, and I like funny words."
11438,What does she mean by HH?
11439,It means we're holding hands.
11440,Are you the cutest?
11441,I'm afraid I might just be.
11442,"You know, what I think is so great that you are totally into this person and yet for all you know she could be like 90 years old, or have two heads, or. It could be a guy."
11443,"Okay, it's not a guy, all right, I know her."
11444,It could be like a big giant guy.
11445,"Man, I got this close to him  and Monica kneed me in the back. What's going on?"
11446,We were just wondering if Chandler's girlfriend is a girl.
11447,"Oh, well. Just ask her how long she's gonna live. Women live longer than men."
11448,How do you not fall down more?
11449,"Okay, ask her 'What is her current method of birth control?'"
11450,"All right.  ""My husband is sleeping with his secretary."" She's married! "
11451,Well at least we know she's a woman.
11452,I can't believe she's married.
11453,"Aw, man I'm sorry . This must be very tough for ya, huh ."
11454,"So, I read this article in the paper the other day that says you're not supposed to throw rice at weddings, because when pigeons eat rice it kills them."
11455,"Oh, that's why you never see pigeons at sushi bars. See, we're having fun."
11456,"Oh, absolutely. Yeah, you know I'm not even thinking about that thing that we're not supposed to think about."
11457,Neither am I.
11458,"Hey, there. "
11460,Are you all right?
11461,"Yeah, when I was in the bathroom I saw the window that I crawled out of at my wedding, and God, I just started thinking that I shouldn't be here, you know I shouldn't, people are going to be looking at me and judging me and, and thinking about the last time."
11462,"Sweetie, it's be gonna okay, all right. It's a wedding, generally people focus on the bride."
11463,"God I know, you're right."
11464,"All rightie, everybody look at me. Good. All right, its time. Bridesmaids and ushers let's see two lines, thank you."
11465,"Okay, I'll see you after the thing."
11466,"Okay, good luck "
11467,"Thank you, Okay, Okay. "
11468,Why the hell didn't you tell me!
11469,"I'm sorry. What was I supposed to do stand up and shout 'Hey, Rachel, your butt is showing!'"
11470,"Oh my God this is sooo humiliating. I think the only thing that tops that was, was, was when I was in the eight grade and I had to sing the Copa Cabana in front of the entire school. I think I got about two lines into it before I ran and freaked out. Oh my God, my entire life is flashing before my eyes."
11471,"Rach, hey look, I remember that, it wasn't so bad."
11472,"Oh Ross, would you stop, you got me, I'm dating you."
11473,Rachel!
11474,"Oh hi, Mr. Wineburg, hi Mrs. Wineburg."
11475,"It's so wonderful to see you again, my dear, in fact I hardly expected to see so much."
11476,You told me you didn't see anything.
11477,I tell ya a lot things!
11478,"Well it's wonderful to have you up and about, again, dear."
11479,Stay well.
11480,"Okay, now that is the third time someone has said something like that to me today."
11481,Rach! Rach!
11482,"Oh, hi!"
11483,"Oh my God, I'm married!"
11485,I'm Mrs. Dr. Barry Hunter hyphen Farber.
11486,"Oh honey, I'm so proud of you, Min."
11487,"Min. Oh Rach, you're still here, at our wedding, they were packing up the chopped liver about now."
11488,"Yeah, I love that story. Um, I got a question for you guys. Why do people keep is saying that is good to see me up and about?"
11489,"Well uh, after you ran out on your wedding, Barry's parents told people that you were sort of....insane."
11490,Insane!
11491,...from the syphilis.
11493,"Yeah, what are they gonna say you didn't love me anymore. Come on."
11494,"Angela? Joey Tribiani. Listen, what are ya doing tonight. I know your seeing that guy I was thinking maybe you could bring him.....Hello? Hello? (picks up a statue of an Indian and walks into "
11495,"Aren't you gonna answer her, that's like the tenth bing-bong message she sent. She wants to know what's wrong?"
11496,What's wrong? What's wrong? You're married that's what's wrong.
11497,"Oh, my."
11499,She wants to meet you in person.
11500,"Hey, look, Phoebe I wanted to meet her in person too, okay, but she's married, she has a husband."
11501,"What if the husband person is the wrong guy, and you are the right guy. I mean you don't get chances like this all the time, if you don't meet her now, you're gonna be kicking yourself when your 80, which is hard to do, and that's how you break a hip."
11502,"Okay, I'll do it!"
11503,"Oh, yeah! Okay! Great! Go, man, go put on your shoes, and, and march out there and meet her!  Oh, wait, no, no you have to take a shower, 'cause, eww.  No, you know what you have to answer her, answer her first.  No, no, you know what make some coffee 'cause its too much. "
11504,"Okay, one more, please. Come on, I'm gonna get it in this time, I will."
11505,"Okay, last chance.  Again, I'm sorry."
11506,"You know what, maybe I don't need to have children. You know maybe I just think I do because that is what society, and by that I mean my mom, has always convinced me that I... I do, I have to have children, I'm sorry, I just do."
11507,"Yo! Can I have your attention, please, Best Man, making a toast here. Thank you.  I remember when Barry got home from his first date with Rachel..."
11509,"What,  you hired the same band I can't use the same speech.  Thank you, thank you very much. Anyway, I wish you both a wonderful life together. And Rachel..."
11511,"No, no, no now in all seriousness, its not a lot of women would've had the guts to come back here tonight, and even fewer, who would do it with their asses hanging out! "
11512,"Uh, I like to, uh, to add something to that..."
11513,"Why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding, why are you adding?"
11514,"Most of you don't know me, I'm Rachel's boyfriend."
11515,Oh dear God.
11516,"Ross, uh and uh, I'd just like to say that it did take a lot of courage for Rachel to come here tonight. And, uh, for the record she did not run out on Barry because she had syphilis.   What are you doing I'm serious. Uh, the reason she walked out on, on Barry is simply that she didn't love him, which incidentally worked out pretty well for me  Cheers."
11517,She you in the parking lot.
11518,"No, Rach!"
11519,And once again she is out of here. Okay who had 9:45? Um?
11520,"Ya, know what Barr, I'm not gonna leave. I probably should, but I'm not, see 'cause I promised myself that I would make it through at least *one* of your weddings . See now, tonight, all I "
11521,"Marenge,"
11522,"""...marenge, thank you honey, and do the cha-cha. And while she like to be a star, Tony always tended bar. At the, wait, wait, everybody.."""
11523,Everybody!
11524,"At the Copa, Copa Cabana  The hottest spot north of Havana. At the Copa, Coo-pa Ca-ban-a, music and fashion were always the passion, at the Copa...."
11525,"Okay, I'll do it."
11526,You'll do what?
11527,If kids is what I takes to be with you then kids it is.
11529,"If I have to I'll, I'll do all again , I'll do the 4 o'clock feeding thing, I'll go to the P.T.A. meetings, I'll coach the soccer team."
11531,"Yeah, if I have to. Monica, I don't wanna lose you, so if I have to do it all over again, then I will."
11532,"You're the most wonderful man. And if you hadn't of said 'if I have to' like seventeen times, then I'd be saying 'okay, let's do it.'"
11533,But you're not.
11534,"Oh my God, I can't believe what I'm getting ready to say. I wanna have a baby, but I don't wanna have one with someone who doesn't really wanna have one."
11535,God. I love you.
11536,I know you do. Me too.  So what now?
11537,I guess we just keep dancing.
11538,"Where is she, Where is she?  Oh, hey, I have a question, where is she?"
11539,"Chandler, relax, Chandler, she'll be here."
11540,"Ooh, oh, oh, that's her."
11541,"Yeah, 'cause life's just that kind."
11542,"Chandler, you gotta stop staring at the door. It's like a watched pot, you know if you keep looking at it then the door is to, never gonna boil. I think what you have to do is try not to..."
11544,OH.....MY.....GAWD!! 
11545,OH.....MY.....GOD!!
11546,"All right I've been feeling incredibly guilty about this, because I wanna be a good friend, and dammit I am a good friend. So just, just shut up and close your eyes ."
11547,"Wow, you are a good friend, 'course the audition was this morning, and I didn't get it. But that was a hell of a kiss. Rachel is a very lucky girl."
11548,Michael Curtis and Gregory S. Malins
11550,I'm tellin' ya that girl totally winked at me.
11551,"Did not, she did not wink at you...."
11553,I have to say Tupolo Honey by Van Morrison.
11554,Nooo Way! The most romantic song ever is The Way We Were.
11555,"See, I-I think that one that Elton John wrote for, um, that guy on Who's The Boss."
11556,"What song was that, Pheebs?"
11557,"Hold me close, young Tony Dan-za."
11558,Hi Monica!
11559,Hey Mon!
11561,"Oh my God, has she slept at all?"
11563,"No, it's been three nights in a row."
11564,"Yeah, she finally stopped crying yesterday, but then she found one of Richard's cigar butts out on the terrace, so."
11565,"Oh, okay that explains it. I got a call at two in the morning, but all I could hear was, like, this high squeaky sound, so I thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum. But then I realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call."
11567,"Morning, hey, you made pancakes?"
11568,"Yeah, like there's any way I could ever do that."
11569,"Monica and Rachel had syrup, now I can get my man to cheer up.  Good morning Joey."
11571,"Hey, you know what, here's a thought. Why don't you stay home from work today and just hang out with me."
11572,"Oh, I wish. Look, honey, you have that report to finish, and I gotta go see my lawyer."
11573,I can not believe that I am going out with someone that is getting divorced. I'm such a grown up.
11574,"I-I-I gotta go, I gotta go. Okay, not without a kiss."
11575,"Well, maybe I won't kiss you, and then you'll have to stay."
11576,Kiss her! Kiss her!
11577,"I'll see you later, sweetie. Bye Joey."
11578,B-bye Janice. So when ya' dumpin' her.
11579,"Nope, not this time."
11580,"Come on, quite yankin' me."
11581,I'm not yanking you.
11582,This is Janice.
11583,"Yeah, I know. She makes me happy."
11584,"Okay. All right. You look me in the eye and tell me, without blinking, that you're not breaking up with her. No blinking."
11585,I'm not breaking up with her! 
11586,"God, look what I found in the drain."
11588,It's some of Richard's hair!  What do I do with this?
11589,Getting it away from me would be job one.
11590,"It's weird, but you know what I don't wanna throw this away. I mean this is like all I have left of him, gross, drain hair. Ooh! "
11591,"Ooh. Oh. It looks like, like a tiny little person drowning in your cereal. "
11592,"God, what is wrong with me."
11593,You need to get some sleep.
11594,I need to get some Richard.
11595,"Monica, you broke up with him for a reason."
11596,"I know, I know. I'm just so tired of-of missing him. I'm tired of wondering why hasn't he called. Why hasn't he called!"
11597,"Maybe, because you told him not to."
11598,What are you the memory woman?
11599,Their not breaking up. Chandler and Janice. Their not breaking up. He didn't blink or anything.
11600,"Well, you know I'm not surprised. I mean have you seen them together, they're really cute."
11601,Cute! This is Janice! You remember Janice?
11602,"Yes, Joey, I remember, she's annoying, but you know what she's-she's his girlfriend now. I mean what can we do?"
11603,There you go! That's the spirit I'm looking for! What can we do? Huh? All right who's first? Huh? Ross?
11604,"Well I'm thinking that Chandler's our friend and Janice makes him happy, so I say we just all be adult about it and accept her."
11605,"Yeah, we'll call that Plan B. All right?"
11606,"Honey, I was wondering...."
11607,Hmm?
11608,"Do you still have that, um, Navy uniform?"
11609,"Nooo, I had to return it to the costume place."
11610,Hmm.
11611,I think I have an old band uniform from high school.
11612,"You remember not having sex in high school, right?"
11614,"Well honey, what about you?"
11616,"I mean do you have any fun, you know, fantasy type things?"
11618,Come on you gotta have one!
11620,"Ross, you know what..."
11622,"...if you tell me, I might do it."
11623,"Okay, umm. Did you ever see, um, Return Of The Jedi?"
11625,"Do you remember the scene with, um, Jabba the Hut? Well Jabba had as, as his prisoner, um, Princess Leia."
11627,"Princess Leia, was wearing this, um, gold bikini thing. It was pretty cool."
11628,"Yeah, oh, Princess Leia and the gold bikini, every guy our age loved that."
11630,"Um, um. It's huge. Yeah, that's the moment, when-when, you know she stopped being a princess, and became, like, a woman, you know."
11631,Did you ever do the-the Leia thing?
11632,"Oh, yeah, um-mm. Oh!"
11633,Really! That-that great huh?
11634,No it's just that I got this new pager and I have it on vibrate. See ya!
11636,Hi you guys!
11637,Look who I found standing outside of the Szechwan Dragon staring at a parking meter.
11638,Mon. Hi!
11640,Why aren't you at work?
11641,"Oh, they-they sent me home."
11643,Because I don't work at the Szechwan Dragon.
11645,"You really, really need to get some sleep, honey."
11646,I know I do.
11651,They published my paper.
11652,"Oh, really, let me see, let me see."
11653,"Rach, look!  Oh, hi! Where is my strong Ross Skywalker to come rescue me.  There he is."
11655,Wheel!
11656,Of!
11657,Fortune! This guy is so stupid.  It's Count Rushmore!!
11658,"You know, you should really go on this show. All right, listen, I got three tickets to the Rangers tonight. What'd ya' say?"
11659,"I say, 'I am there!' Cool! Aw, is Ross going to?"
11660,"No, Janice."
11661,"Jan-ice. 'Cause I, just, I feel bad for Ross, you know, we-we always go together, we're like the three hocke-teers."
11662,"You know, I may be way out on a limb here, but do you, do you, have a problem with Janice?"
11663,"No, Yeeees. God, how do I say this. . Oh, hi, you know that girl from the Greek restaurant with the hair ?"
11664,"Ooh, that girl that I hate, eww, drives me crazy, eww, eww, oh!"
11665,"Look, I don't hate Janice, she's-she's just a lot to take, you know."
11667,"Oh, hey. Come on man, don't look at me like that, she used to drive you nuts before too, remember?"
11668,"Well, I'm crazy about her now. I think this could be the real thing. Capital 'R'! Capital 'T'!  Don't worry, those are the right letters."
11669,"Look, what do you want me to say?"
11670,I want you to say that you like her!
11671,"I can't. It's like this chemical thing, you know. Every time she starts laughing, I just wanna  pull my arm off just so that I can have something to throw at her."
11672,"Thanks for trying.  Oh, and by the way there is no Count Rushmore!"
11673,"Yeah, then-then who's the guy that painted the faces on the mountain? "
11674,How could you have told her?
11675,"Ross, I didn't think it would that big of a deal."
11676,"Oh, she didn't think it would be that big of deal."
11677,"Okay, who are you talking to when you do that?"
11678,"Look, that was supposed to be like a private, personal thing between us."
11679,"Okay, Ross, Phoebe is my girlfriend, okay, we tell each other everything. You know, I mean, come on, guys do the same thing, I mean, what about all that locker room stuff."
11680,"That's different, okay. That's like, uh 'Who dated a stripper?' or 'Who did it on the back of the Staton Island Ferry?'."
11681,Were both of those Joey?
11682,"Yeah. Look, you don't, you don't talk about like, you know, your girlfriend and the intimate stuff you, you do with her."
11683,Not even with your best friend.
11684,Noo!
11685,"That is so sad. Your missing out on so much, Ross. I mean, the bonding and the sharing, you know. And-and knowing that someone else is going through the same thing you are."
11686,"Hmph. So what you, you tell each other everything?"
11688,Did you talk about the night of five times? Do you tell people about the night of five times?
11689,"Uh, honey, yeah that was with Carol."
11690,"I know, but it's still worth mentioning, I think."
11691,"Relax every muscle in your body. Listen to the plinky-plunky music. Okay, now close you eyes, and think of a happy place. Okay, tell me your happy place."
11692,"Richard's living room, drinking wine."
11693,"All right. No, no, no, not a Richard thing, just put down the glass. And get out!"
11694,"I'm sorry, but that's my happy place."
11695,"Well, okay, fine, use my happy place. Okay, I'm just gonna, I have to ask that you don't move anything."
11696,"All right, I'll try not to."
11697,"Okay, all right, so, your in a meadow, millions of stars in the sky...."
11698,Do you think breaking up with him was a huge mistake?
11699,"All right, there are no questions in the happy place. Okay, just, the warm breeze, and the moonlight flowing through the trees...."
11700,"I'll bet he's totally over me, I'll bet he's fine."
11701,"All right, betting and wagering of any kind, are, I'm sure, not permitted in the happy place. Okay. Just-just, you know, the-the lovely waterfalls, and the, the trickling fountains. And the-the calming sounds of the babbling brook...."
11702,"Okay, this isn't working. I'm still awake and now I have to pee."
11703,"So, I hear, you hate me!"
11704,"I, ah, I never said hate, I was very careful about that."
11705,A little birdie told me something about you wanting to rip your arm off and throw it at me.
11706,And you got a 'hate' from that?! Your taking a big leap there...
11707,"All right, fine, fine, fine, fine, fine, we've got to do something about our little situation here Joey. So, this is my idea: you and me spending some quality time together."
11708,But what does that gonna do...
11709,For Chandler!
11710,Okay. I'm in.
11711,Okay. All right. This is what we're gonna call it: 'Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!'
11712,Does it have to be a whole day?
11713,"Yes, because that's how long it takes to love me."
11714,"Yeah, I know, I sleep in the next room."
11715,"So, I went down to the post office, and it turns out it was those videos that I ordered for Richard about the Civil w*r. He loved the Civil w*r."
11716,"Monica, do you want us to take you home?"
11717,"Uh, huh.  Or maybe to a galaxy far, far away. "
11718,Women tell each other everything. Did you know that?
11719,"Umm, yeah."
11720,"No Chandler, everything! Like stuff you like, stuff she likes, technique, stamina, girth...."
11721,"Girth? Why, why, why, wh-why, why, why, why would they do this?"
11722,"Rachel says sharing's great and supposedly, you know, we outta be doing it. Do you wanna?"
11723,We're not gonna talk about girth are we?
11727,Yeah! All right! You go first.
11728,"Okay, okay, I'll go first."
11730,"So, uh, the other night Rachel and I are in bed talking about fantasies, and I happened to describe a particular Star Wars thing...."
11731,Princess Leia in the gold bikini.
11734,"Yes! Wow, well, that-that was easy. Okay, you-you go."
11737,"Okay, you know, you know when your in bed, with a woman."
11738,Hmph.
11739,"And, ah, you know, your fooling around with her. And you get all these like, mental images in your brain, you know, like Elle MacPherson, or that girl at the Xerox place...."
11740,"With the belly-button ring? Oh, muhawa!"
11741,"I know, And then all of the sudden your Mom pops into your head. And your like 'Mom, get outta here!' You know, but of course, like, after that you can't possibly think of anything else, and you can't, you know, stop what your doing. So it's kinda like, you're, you know. You know.... You don't know!"
11742,"Your Mom, your telling me, your telling me, about your Mom, what is the matter with you?"
11743,You said...
11744,I said 'share' not 'scare'. Go sit over there! .
11745,We're baack!
11747,What are you guys doing together?
11748,Joey and Janice's DAY OF FUN!!! 
11750,"Yeah, yeah. We went to a Mets game, we got Chinese food, and you know, I love this woman. You have got competition buddy."
11751,"I just came by to give you a kiss, I have to go pick up the baby, so. I'll see you later sweetheart, you too Chandler. "
11752,You still can't stand her can you?
11753,"I'm sorry man, I tired, I really did."
11754,"Well, you know, I appreciate you giving it a sh*t."
11755,"But, hey, look, you know the good thing is, is that we spent the whole day together and I survived, and what's even more amazing, so did she. It was bat day at Shea Stadium."
11756,"Well, I guess that's something."
11757,"No man, that's huge! Now, I know I can stand to be around her, which means I get to hang out with you, which is kinda the whole point, anyway."
11759,"Oh, hey, Chandler, we, ah, we stopped by the coffee shop and ran into Ross."
11761,"Hey, if it makes you feel any better, I do it too."
11763,"Oh yeah, I always picture your Mom when I'm having sex."
11764,"Hi, Dad, what are you doing here?"
11765,"Well, it's your mother's bridge night so I thought that I would come into the city for a little Monicuddle.  Since when did you start smoking cigars?"
11766,"I don't, I just, I just like the smell of them. So, uh, what are you really doing here Dad?"
11767,"Well, I just wanted to make sure you were okay."
11768,What makes you think that I might not be okay?
11769,I saw Richard.
11771,"So, how are you doing?"
11772,"I'm fine, just a little tired, I'm okay. How's Richard doing?"
11773,You don't wanna know.
11774,"No, I really, really do."
11775,"Well, he's doing terrible!"
11777,Worse than when he broke up with Barbara.
11778,You're not just saying that are you?
11779,"No, the man is a mess."
11780,Was he crying?
11782,"Well, do you think he was waiting 'til after you left, so he could cry?"
11784,I think so.
11785,"Honey, relationships are hard. Like with your Mom and me. You know after we graduated college we broke up for a while. It seems her Father, your Grandfather, wanted her to travel around Europe, like he did. Of course, he got to do it on Uncle Sam's nickel, because he was also strafing German troop trains at the time. However, "
11786,"Okay, here we go. I'm Jabba's prisoner, and you have a really weird look on your face. What? Honey, what is it? Did I get it wrong? Did I get the hair wrong? What? Did you just picture it differently? What? What?"
11787,"No, no it's, um, it's not you, um, it's um, it's "
11788,"Well what is it? Come on sweetie, your like, freaking me out here."
11789,"I hate Chandler, the bastard ruined my life. "
11790,Ira Ungerleider
11792,"All right they got water, orange juice, and what looks like cider. "
11793,Taste it.
11794,"Yep, it's fat. I drank fat!"
11795,"Yeah, I know, I did that two minutes ago."
11797,"Hey, mister tux!"
11798,Why aren't you guys dressed?
11799,We have a half hour.
11800,"No, four minutes ago you had a half hour, we have to be out the door at twenty to eight."
11801,"Relax Ross, we'll be ready. It only takes us two minutes to get dressed."
11802,"Well, you know, I'd feel a whole lot better if you got dressed now."
11804,"Hey-hey! Oh, look at you, all sexy."
11806,"Ooooh! Wow!! Oh, hi."
11808,How come you didn't come over earlier?
11809,"'Cause, I'm a stupid, stupid man."
11810,"Hey, Ross, want some cider?"
11811,"No.  So, um, let's see your pretty close, huh. Make-up's on, hair's done."
11812,"Yeah, I just have to get dressed."
11813,Yay! And that takes what? Just six or seven minutes.
11814,"Yeah! Once, I figure out what I'm wearing."
11815,Glass of fat?
11816,What's a matter Ross? What you're nervous about your speech?
11817,No! Do you wanna hear it?
11818,Am I in it?
11819,"Uh, huh. Yeah, right after I thank everyone for giving money to the museum, I sing a song about the wonder that is Joey."
11823,"Wow, hello! You look great!"
11824,"Thank you! I know, though."
11825,"You see this, this is a person who is ready to go. Phoebe you, oh, you are my star."
11826,"Ohh, well, you're my lucky penny."
11827,"All right, I took the quiz, and it turns out, I do put career before men.  Get up."
11829,You're in my seat.
11830,How is this your seat?
11831,'Cause I was sitting there.
11832,But then you left.
11833,"Well, it's not like I went to Spain. I went to the bathroom, you knew I was coming back."
11834,"What's the big deal, sit somewhere else."
11835,"The big deal is I was sitting there last, so, that's my seat."
11836,"Well, actually the last place you were sitting was in there . Soo..."
11837,"You guys, you know what, you know what, it doesn't matter, because you both have to go get dressed before the big vain in my head pops. So.."
11838,"All right, Ross, I just have to do one thing, really quickly, it's not a big deal.  GET UP!!"
11841,"Ooh, Phoebe, you look great!"
11842,All right all ready.
11843,"Ooh, are you gonna do magic?"
11844,"That's, that's funny. Change!"
11845,Hang on a second I just got in.
11846,"Look, I don't care it starts at eight, we can't be late."
11847,"We could not, would not want to wait."
11848,"Look, our table is down in front, okay, my boss is gonna be there, everyone will see if we arrive after it starts."
11849,Has somebody been drinking my fat? 
11850,"You guys,  does this look like something the girlfriend of a paleontologist would wear?"
11851,"I don't know, you might be the first one."
11852,"Rach, did you check the machine?"
11853,"Uh, no. Wait, you know what, this is the outfit that makes my calves look fat. Nevermind."
11854,"Well, Joey, I wrote a little song today. It's called: Get Up."
11855,All right! You can have the chair.
11857,"Oh my, would you look at that! "
11858,"""Hi, it's me, I'm coming over now. Hey, what if I'm already there when your playing this message?""  Is that too spooky?"
11859,"""Hi Rach, are you there? It's me, pick up. Rachel. Rach!"""
11861,Nevermind.
11862,"""Monica, it's Richard. Call me."""
11863,Is-is-is that message old or new?  Old or new?! Old or new?!
11864,"It's old, it's definitely old. Didn't you hear the, the double beep?"
11865,"What if it's new? I mean, we agreed not to talk again, unless we had something really important to say. Shouldn't I call him back?"
11866,"Honey, you did call him back. 'Cause, it's, it's really old."
11867,"Yeah, see Mon, listen, listen. When Carol and I broke up, I went through the same thing. And you know what I did?"
11869,"I.....got.....dressed. Really, really quickly. Okay, okay.  There we go, there we go."
11870,"You know what, okay, fine. Don't get up, you just sit right there. I just hope, you don't mind, you know, my hand right here.  Op, not touching, can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! Not touching can't get mad! "
11871,Ah! Oh my God! You r-r-rotten boys!
11872,Sorry Phoebe.
11873,I'm so sorry.
11874,What am I gonna do?
11875,"No, no, don't, don't, rub it! Don't!  What gets out hummus?! What gets out hummus?!"
11876,"Monica, Monica, you know what gets out hummus."
11877,"If it is a new message, what is he calling to say?"
11878,"Okay, thanks. Yeah, I'll try that."
11879,Maybe he's calling to say your obsessive and crazy.
11880,"So, should I call him back?"
11881,Noo!  NO!
11882,"All right, fine, you know what, we'll both sit in the chair.  I'm soooo, comfortable."
11883,"Me too. In fact, I think I might be a little too comfortable."
11884,All right! 
11885,"Okay, look, we have nineteen minutes. Okay, Chandler, I want you to go and change! Okay. And then, when you come back, Joey will go change, and he'll have vacated the chair. Okay. Okay."
11886,"All right! Fine! I'm going. But when I get back it's chair sitting, and I'm the guy who's....sitting in a chair! "
11887,"Is this a little too...  Pheebs, what happened?"
11888,Hummus. I got the hummus.
11889,"Ooooh! Honey, well we'll find you something. Do you wanna wear my black jacket?"
11890,That won't go with this dress though.
11891,"No, you're right. Well, we'll find something. Let's just get you out of that. Come on."
11892,"No, no, no, no, no, no, not out of that, not out of clothes."
11893,"Monica, can Phoebe borrow your green dress?"
11894,I called him.
11896,"Yes. Well I got his machine and I left a message. But it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, because you know it was like a casual, breezy message. It was breezy! Oh God, what if it wasn't breezy?"
11897,"Well, how could it not be breezy, no, 'cause, you're, you're in such a breezy place."
11898,"Here, I got it. I'll will play my message for you guys, and you can tell me if it's breezy enough."
11899,"Monica, how are you gonna do that?"
11900,I know the code to his answering machine.
11901,"Okay, Mon, I really don't think this is the... Okay, you're dialing, you are dialing."
11902,"""Hi, this is Richard. Please, leave a message at the tone."""
11903,"""You have two new messages."""
11904,"Wow, what a cool job.  'You have two new messages.' 'Please, pass the pie.'"
11905,"""Hi, it's Monica. I'm just checking in 'cause I got this message from you and I didn't know if it was old or new or what. So, I'm just checkin'. So let me know, or don't, whatever. I'm breezy."""
11906,"Hey, you can't say you're breezy, that, that totally negates the breezy."
11907,"Hola, it's me, yesterday was really fun. Call me about this weekend, okay."
11908,Now she sounded breezy.
11909,He's seeing someone. I can't believe he's seeing someone.
11910,"Monica, you don't know that."
11911,"Well, who's voice was that?"
11912,"Maybe it was his sister's. You know, maybe it was his daughter's."
11913,"Michelle! Of course, it was Michelle! Did it sound like Michelle?"
11914,"Oh, great. It's starting to rain, that will make it easy to get a cab."
11915,It was Michelle. It was definitely Michelle.
11916,"Pheebs, you go with Monica and try on her green dress. If that doesn't work, you can wear my gray silk one. Oh, gosh, what am I wearing?!"
11917,"You don't, you don't know what your wearing?"
11918,"Well, hon-ey. I'm just trying to look nice for your big night."
11919,"Yeah, which, which we have to leave for in exactly twelve minutes. All right, come on, I'll just pick something out for you."
11920,"All right, you will notice that I am fully dressed. I, in turn, have noticed that you are not. So in the words of A. A. Milne, ""Get out of my chair, dillhole!"""
11923,"You said I had to give you the chair, you didn't say anything about the cushions."
11924,The cushions are the essence of the chair!
11925,That's right! I'm taking the essence.
11926,"Oh-ho, it'll be back. Oh-ho, there's nobody in the room."
11927,"Look, I'm sorry, I thought it looked pretty."
11928,"Ross, that was a Halloween costume, unless you would like me to go to this thing as Little Bo Peep."
11929,"Look, I didn't recognize it without that inflatable sheep."
11930,"Yeah, which, by the way Chandler, I would like back one of these days."
11931,"Oh Rach, good, listen isn't this perfect for me! "
11932,"Oh, it's perfect! But not for tonight."
11933,"Well, of course not for tonight. Yeah, hi!"
11934,"Not for tonight. Not for tonight! Wh-what, what, what, are you doing?"
11935,"No honey, we're sorry, we didn't mean it. I love you. I love you."
11936,We used them as pillows when we went camping.
11938,The sheep.
11939,"Hey, what you do on your own time..."
11940,Where's my underwear?!
11941,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Come on, come on, what. You took his underwear?"
11942,He took my essence!
11943,"Okay, now hold on. Joey, why, why can't you just wear the underwear you're wearing now?"
11944,"Because, I'm not wearing any underwear now."
11945,"Okay, then why do you have to wear underwear tonight?"
11946,It's a rented tux. Okay. I'm not gonna go commando in another man's fatigues.
11947,"Well, then it looks like somebody is gonna have to give back somebody his cushions."
11948,"Okay, you hide my clothes. I'm gonna do the exact opposite to you."
11949,"What are you, what are you gonna show me my clothes?"
11950,"Hey, opposite, is opposite! "
11951,He's got nothing!
11952,"Okay, I'm ready."
11953,"Oh, aaaah!"
11954,"Rachel, didn't have anything that I liked, so, but she had this Christmas ribbon, and I thought, 'All right, fine I'll be political.'"
11955,What are you supporting?
11956,Duh!! Christmas!
11957,"Okay, hey, that's okay with me. Two down and I have exactly twelve minutes.... Wha, my watch stopped. My watch.  Okay, see, the, the dinosaur tail isn't going around any more.  What time is it? It's 7:33, I have seven minutes. I have seven minutes!!"
11958,"Okay, Pheebs, quick, what shoes should I wear? The black or the purple?"
11959,"Just, just, just pick one!"
11960,"Okay, okay, okay, the black. But, oh, do you have black, with the little strappys?"
11961,"Yeahh, but, but those really go better with pants. Maybe I should wear pants?"
11962,"Yeah, pants, what, what an idea. Or better yet, um, how 'bout you go without any pants. Look, I don't know what you're trying to do to me, but just get your butt in there and pick out any shoes that fit your feet, okay. No, no I don't care if they match. I don't care if they make your ankles or your knees or your earlobes look fat. Okay."
11963,But I...
11964,"No, no, no just do it. Go in there and pick something out so we can go."
11967,"Okay. I gotta call Michelle. I gotta see if that was her voice or not. I'm sorry, I just have to."
11968,"It was, it was her voice."
11969,"Monica, I think you've gone over to the bad place."
11970,Hola! Hello. Hello?
11971,Okay. That was her right?
11972,Definitely.
11973,"See there you go. Woo! We're out of the woods. Okay, I'll get dressed now."
11974,Yay!
11975,"I'll get it, okay.  Hi, Monica and Rachel's.  Yeah, just a second, can I ask who's calling.  Oh, ew, it's Michelle! Ew! She, she must have that Caller Id thing. You should get that."
11976,"Uh, Michelle. Yeah, that was me, I-I dialed your number by mistake.  Oh, you're so sweet. Yeah, we were a great couple. I know I really miss him. Well, you know how it is, it's that...."
11977,"You know what's weird. Donald Duck never wore pants. But whenever he's getting out of the shower, he always put a towel around his waist. I mean, what is that about?"
11978,"Michelle, I only beeped in so I could hear my message. I mean that's allowed. Yeah-huh! I mean look, yeah, you know what I would really appreciate it if you didn't tell your Dad about. What do you mean, you're not comfortable with this? Come on we're friends!!  That bitch always hated me. I'm calling her back."
11979,"No, no, no, no. Tick, tick, tick, tick."
11980,"Okay, fine. "
11981,"They got a phone in there, right?"
11982,"Okay, we're on it. We're on it."
11983,"Um. I know it says black tie optional, but, um this may be pushing it a little, um."
11984,I'm not gonna gooo.
11985,You're not going to go.
11986,"No, I think I'm gonna catch up on my correspondence."
11987,"How, how, um how can you not be going?"
11988,"I'm not gonna gooo, so I think that will accomplish the not going."
11989,"Um, you know, just out of curiosity..."
11990,"Well, ever since I was humiliated and yelled at in front of my friends, I'm just, I don't know, not in a museum benefitty kind of mood."
11991,"Right. Right, okay, okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I yelled."
11992,It's fine.
11993,"No, but, your-your mad."
11994,I'm not mad.
11996,I'm just not going.
11997,Your not going.
11999,Okay. You know that I-I have to go.
12000,"Um, hum."
12001,Right. So is it gonna be like 'I'm abandoning you while your upset.'
12003,"No, because your not upset."
12005,About the yelling.
12006,"Right, and the humiliating."
12007,"Oh, well of course, the humiliating. So, so wee, we're okay."
12011,Okay. Honey?
12012,"Yes, Ross. "
12013,I love you. 
12014,Get away from that! No!  She's just getting dressed.
12015,Is it wrong that I was totally aroused by that?
12016,"Okay, buddy-boy. Here it is. You hide my clothes, I'm wearing everything you own."
12017,Oh my God! That is so not the opposite of taking somebody's underwear!!
12018,Look at me! I'm Chandler! Could I be wearing any more clothes? Maybe if I wasn't going commando...
12019,Oooo-ooh!
12020,"Yeah. Whew, it's hot with all of this stuff on. I ah, I better not do any, I don't know, lunges. "
12021,"Okay, okay. Enough, enough with the lunging. No! I'm sick of this. Okay. I've had it up to here with you two! Neither you can come to the party!"
12022,"Jeez, what a baby."
12023,"Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed."
12024,"You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there. Look, what, what can I do that can show you how much, how much I want you to be there."
12025,You could drink the fat.
12026,"Hi, welcome, to an adult conversation."
12027,"No, no, no, now wait, wa, wa, waa-it a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. That actually, uh, that sounds interesting."
12029,I think you should drink the fat.
12030,Yaaaay!
12031,"Okay, okay. If that is what it takes to show you how much you mean to me, and how much I want you there. Then that's what I'll do."
12032,"Oh, wait, let me get you another glass. That's been sitting out."
12033,"I think this will be fine. Okay, vanilla milkshake, just a vanilla milkshake, with chicken bits floating in it. Cheers. "
12034,"No, no, no, wait! Okay, okay. Don't! I'll go, I'll go!"
12035,You will?!
12036,"You were really gonna do that, weren't you?"
12037,"Well, yeah."
12038,You were gonna drink the fat.
12039,Let's see what else he'll do!
12040,"How 'bout instead you, go get changed!  You, give him back his underwear! I'm gonna go get a cab, and I want everyone down stairs in two minutes! Monica!"
12041,Stop it. Stop it!
12042,"Ross, went to get a cab so we can all... No, wh-what are you doing! No, Monica, no!"
12043,"Hi, this is Richard."
12044,You have three new messages.
12045,Not any more!
12046,Message erased. To record a message begin speaking at the tone.
12047,"Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know. Um, anyway, I, I, I beeped into your machine and I heard a message that, that freaked me out, and um, you know what Michelle will tell you the rest. I, I, um, I'm sorry, okay, I, I hope that we can forget the whole thing. Okay, bye."
12048,Your outgoing message has now been changed.
12049,"Outgoing! Did that say outgoing?! Not, outgoing!!!"
12050,"""Hi, uh, Richard it's Monica, um, listen I did something kind of crazy tonight, um, maybe I'm getting my period or something, I don't know."" Nooo!!"
12051,How did you do that?
12052,I don't know!
12053,Good-bye.
12054,Noooo!!!!
12055,"Okay, okay, okay, I've got two cabs and no people. Go! Go! Go!"
12056,Maybe we could call the phone company. Maybe they could change the message. Maybe they can change his number.
12057,"Yeah, after this, I think he'll be doing that himself."
12058,"Rachel!!  Wow! You, uh, you look, wow!"
12059,"And I still have about five seconds to spare.  Okay, that was about seven seconds."
12060,So we're a little late.
12061,"Come on.  Oh! And, uh, by the way...."
12063,"I'm going commando, too."
12064,Awwww!!!
12065,"Dr. Geller, Sherman Whitfield, London Institute."
12066,Wow! What a pleasure.
12067,"Well, I have to tell you, I was quite impressed with your paper on Pre-Cretaceous fossils. Yeah, it confirmed everything that I have written."
12070,"Well, your kind of sitting in my seat."
12071,"What do you mean, your seat?"
12072,"I mean, I was sitting there."
12073,"But, you got up!"
12074,"But, I never left the room!"
12075,"But, you left the chair area."
12076,"All right, that's it, give me your underwear."
12077,Wil Calhoun
12079,WHOAA!!
12080,"See Joe, that's why your parents told you not to jump on the bed."
12081,"Hey, look at me. I'm making jam, been at it since 4 o'clock this morning."
12082,Where'd you get fruit at four in the morning?
12083,Went down to the docks. Bet ya didn't know you could get it wholesale.
12084,I didn't know there were docks.
12087,"Aww, is it broken?"
12088,"No, I gotta wear this thing for a couple weeks. "
12089,Did you tell the doctor you did it jumping up and down on your bed?
12090,Nooo. I had a story all worked out but then Chandler sold me out.
12091,"Well, I'm sorry Joe. I didn't think the doctor was gonna buy that it just *fell* out of the socket."
12092,What is this? Fruit?
12093,Monica's making jam.
12094,"Whoa, jam! I love jam!  Hey, how come we never have jam at our place?"
12095,Because the kids need new shoes.
12096,"I'm going into business people. I'm sick and tired of being depressed about Richard. I needed a plan, a plan to get over my man. What's the opposite of man? Jam.  Oh Joey don't! It's way to hot. "
12097,This will just be my batch.
12098,"Um, that's it. No. Hey! You! J. Crew guy. Yeah. Why have you been following me? I mean, all week long everywhere I look there's you."
12099,"You wouldn't return my calls, you sent back my letters...."
12101,"One more chance Ursula, please?"
12102,"Oooh. Oh, well this is awkward."
12103,Wh..
12104,"Um, yeah, you want Ursula, and I'm Phoebe. Twin sisters! Seriously."
12105,"Oh, that's great. I'm stalking the wrong woman. I am such a dingus!"
12106,"Oh, you're not a dingus."
12107,"I just, I want you to know I didn't used to be like this. Before I meet your sister I was like this normal guy who sold beepers and cellular phones."
12108,"Well, I mean look it's, it's not your fault, you know. I mean this is just what, what she does to guys, okay."
12109,Well thanks. 
12110,"Wait,  you know what, I got a little story. When I was in Junior High School I went through this period where I thought I was a witch. And there was this guidance counselor who said something to me, that I think will help you a lot. He said okay, 'you're not a witch you're just an average student.' See what I'm saying?"
12111,Not really.
12112,"Um, well, get over it. So, I mean you, you just seem to be a really nice guy, you know. Don't be so hard on yourself okay."
12113,"Wait. You're right. I know you're right. And, thanks for being so nice. Here "
12114,"Oh, thanks a lot. Do you want to get a cup of coffee?"
12116,"Okay.  Okay, you don't have to walk behind me any more."
12118,Mon?
12120,'Gone for more jars. Back later. Monica Geller.'
12121,"Wait a minute, look."
12123,"Look, look, look."
12124,"What, what, what?"
12125,It's an empty apartment.
12127,We're all alone in an empty apartment.
12128,"Honey, come on, I have to be at work in like ten minutes  Oh, all right, well it's not like I'm employee of the year or anything. "
12129,There it is.
12130,"Oh, oh, that's what you're talking about.  Hey."
12132,Do I look fat?
12134,"Okay, I accept that. When Janice asked me and I said no, she took that to mean that I was calling her a cow."
12135,"Okay, walk us through it, honey, walk us through it."
12136,"Okay, well. Janice said 'Hi, do I look fat today?' And I, I looked at her...."
12137,"Whoa, whoa, whoa. You looked at her. You never look. You just answer, it's just a reflex. Do I look fat? Nooo! Is she prettier than I am? Noo! Does size matter?"
12139,And it works both ways.
12140,"Okay, so you both just know this stuff?"
12141,"Well you know, after about thirty or forty fights, you kinda catch on."
12142,"Okay, for instance. Let's say, Janice is coming back from a trip and she gives you two options. Option number 1 she'll take a cab home from the airport. Option 2 is you can meet her at baggage claim. Which do you do?"
12143,"That's easy, baggage claim."
12144,"Wrong! Now you're single. It's actually secret option number three, you meet her at the gate. That way she knows you love her."
12145,"Okay, this is good, this is good. All right listen, I have one. Janice likes to cuddle, at night, which, you know I'm all for. But, uh, you know when you want to go to sleep, you want some space. So, uh, how do I tell her that without, you know, accidentally calling her fat or something."
12146,"Oh honey, I'm sorry we can't help you there, 'cause we're cuddlily sleepers.  Okay, I'm late for work."
12148,All right are you guys gonna come down?
12149,"Uh, yeah, yeah I'll, I'm right behind you."
12150,Good luck Chandler.
12151,Thank you Rachel.
12152,Bye sweetie.
12153,Bye hon.
12154,"Okay the sleeping thing. Very tricky business, but there is something you can do."
12155,"Well, I thought you guys were cuddlily sleepers."
12156,"Noo! No, not cuddlily, not me, just her. I'm like you, I need the room. Okay, come here.  Okay, you're in bed..."
12158,I'm gonna use the cushion.
12160,"Okay, you're in bed. She's over on your side, cuddling. Now you wait for her to drift off, and then you hug her  and roll her back over to her side of the bed. And then you rollll a-way. Hug for her! Roll for you."
12161,"Okay, the old hug and roll."
12163,"Okay, one question."
12164,sh**t.
12165,You're pretending the pillow's a girl right?
12166,Remember when you where a kid and your Mom would drop you off at the movies with a jar of jam and a little spoon?
12167,You're so pretty.
12169,"Hey, Phoebe."
12170,"Hey, oh, you know that guy who's been following me? I talked to him today."
12171,You talked to him. Are you crazy?
12172,"Okay, first I'm not crazy. And second, say it don't spray it. Anyway his name is Malcom, and he wasn't following me, I mean he was, but 'cause he thought I was Ursula, ick. And, that's why, that's why he couldn't just come up and talk to me. 'Cause of the restraining order."
12173,"Umm, not feeling better 'bout Malcom."
12174,"Ooh! No, no, no, no, he's not like a kook, no. He's just like this, this very passionate, incredibly romantic guy, that got like a tinsy bit carried away, you know. And we just get along really well, and he's so cute."
12175,"Oh my God, you've got a crush on your sister's stalker."
12176,"No, I'm just gonna help him, you know, get 'de-Ursula-ized', like you know, like I did for Joey after he went out with her."
12177,"Hey, I didn't stalk her. I mean "
12178,"Okay, I asked for the news, not the weather."
12180,Hey Mon.
12181,"Joey, this is for you.  It's blackberry curin."
12182,Aww.  Ohh!
12183,"Hey, Joe, I gotta ask. The girl from the Xerox place buck naked , or, or a big tub of jam. "
12184,Put your hands together.
12185,"Joey, take your time with that. That's my last batch."
12186,No more jam?!
12187,"Well, what happened to your jam plan?"
12188,"I figured out I need to charge seventeen bucks a jar just to break even. So, I've got a new plan now. Babies."
12189,"Well, your gonna need much bigger jars."
12191,I'm talking about me having a baby.
12193,Are you serious?
12194,"Yeah. The great thing about the jam plan was, I was taking control of my life. So I asked myself, what is the most important thing to me in the world and that's when I came up with the baby plan."
12195,"Well, aren't you forgetin' something? What, what, what is uh, what is that guy's name? Dad!"
12196,"It took me 28 years to find one man that I wanna spend my life with, if I have to wait another 28 years then, I'll be 56 before I can have a baby, and that's just stupid."
12197,"That, that's what's stupid."
12198,"I don't need an actual man, just a couple of his best swimmers. And there, there are places you can go to get that stuff."
12199,Down at the docks again?
12200,Night-night Bing-a-ling.
12201,"Night-night.....Janice.  'Look at all that room on her side, you good fit a giant penguin over there. That would be weird though. Okay, hug and roll time. I'm huggin', I'm huggin', your rollin', and....yes! Freedom!  Except for this arm! I'm stuck. Stuck arm! Okay, time for the old table cloth trick, one fluid motion. Quick like a cat, quick like a cat! And 1...2...3!' "
12202,Here's my binoculars.
12203,"Oh, great. Great. You're doing great, you know real strong. Going strong. Keep going."
12204,"These are my night vision goggles. This is the book I pretend to read when I'm watching her in the park. And these are Mad Lips, they're just for fun."
12205,"Oh, yeah. What's this? "
12206,"Oh, this is log I kept, recording her every movement. Do you wanna here something from it?"
12207,"Um, not even a little bit."
12208,It's about you.
12209,"Oh, okay then."
12210,"I met Phoebe today. She was really nice to me eventhough I'm such a loser. And, then when I was walking home I thought about her a lot, it was weird, but kinda cool."
12211,Good. So what were you thinking?
12212,I was thinking what it would be like to kiss you.
12216,"See that's just something I said now, so that maybe I could kiss you."
12217,"Oh, okay. "
12218,"No, that's all right. I just had a jar of mustard."
12219,"Okay, sperm donor number 03815, come on down! Okay, he's 6'2"", 170 pounds, and he describes himself as a male Geena Davis."
12220,You mean there's more than one of us.
12221,"Look, you can't do this Mon. All right, if you do this, I'm, I'm gonna, I'm, I'm gonna....."
12222,You're gonna what?
12223,I'm gonna tell Mom.
12224,"Honey, I'm sorry, but he's right. I love you, but you're crazy."
12225,Crazy.
12226,What?! Why? Why is this crazy? So this isn't the ideal way to something....
12227,"Oh, it's not the ideal way..."
12228,"Lips moving, still talking. I mean it may not be ideal, but I'm so ready. No, I-I-I see the way Ben looks at you. It makes me ache, you know?"
12229,Check it out!! Jam crackers!
12230,"Okay, all right, how's this? 27. Italian-American guy. He's an actor, born in Queens. Wow, big family, seven sisters, and he's the only....boy.  Oh my God, under personal comments: 'New York Knicks, rule!'"
12231,"Yeah, the Knicks rule!"
12232,"Joey, this is you!"
12233,"Let me see.  Oh, right."
12234,When did you go to a sperm bank?
12235,"Well, right after I did that sex study down at NYU.  Hey, Remember that sweater I gave you for your birthday?"
12236,And that's how you bought it?
12237,"Noooo, that's what I was wearing when I donated. I'm kinda surprised there's any of my boys left."
12238,"Well, honey, it is pretty competitive. I mean I've got an actual rocket scientist here."
12239,"Maybe, I should call this place and get them to put my 'Days of Our Lives' on here. You know, juice this puppy up a little."
12240,Hellooo!
12242,How's the maniac?
12243,"Oh, well he's yummy. We did a little kissin'."
12245,"Oh, no, no, no, no. You know what, he's not into that stuff anymore. He quit for me."
12246,"Pheebs, this guy has been obsessed with your sister, for God knows how long, okay, you don't just give up something like that."
12247,"Look, he gave me his night vision goggles and everything."
12248,You're taking the word of a guy who has night vision goggles?
12249,"What, he's not still following her. Do you think he is still following her?"
12250,"Pheebs, wake up and smell the restraining order."
12251,What are you saying I should do?
12252,"I think, that if you really like this guy, you should just trust him."
12253,"Thank you, Monica."
12254,"Orrr, you could follow him and see where he goes."
12255,"Oh, that's what I would do, forget mine."
12256,"Oh my God, what happened? "
12257,"Oh. God, crazy Chandler. He spun me...off...the...bed!"
12258,Wow! Spinning that sounds like fun.
12259,"Oh,  I wish. No, you know he was just trying Ross's Hug and Roll thing."
12260,Ross's what?
12261,"You know what, where he hugs you and kinda rolls you away and... Oh... my....God."
12263,Yes? Yes! Oh.
12265,"Oh, I was just here looking for, um, my um, my part of an old sandwich. Oh, here it is! Oh. "
12266,Were you following me?
12267,"Um, perhaps. Yes! Yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was just afraid that you were still hung up on my sister."
12268,So you spied on me. I can't believe you don't trust me. 
12269,"Oh well, what do you know, there goes my identical twin sister. Just walkin' along looking like me. What, is this just like a freakish coincidence, or did you know she takes this train?"
12270,"I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I tried to stop, but I couldn't. I'm so pathetic."
12271,"No, no, it's not your fault. You know it's partly my fault, 'cause I made you quit cold turkey. Sorry, no. Okay, well, I mean, I can't date you anymore, 'cause your, you know  Wow! But um, but I will definitely, definitely help you get over my sister. Okay, stalk me for a while. Huh? Yeah, and, and, and, I'll be like an Ursula patch."
12272,"Uh-huh, I don't know."
12273,"Yeah, just, okay, look I'm going. Um, come on. Op, op, behind the pillar, which way am I gonna go?"
12276,Where you going?
12277,To the bank.
12278,Sperm or regular?
12279,Sperm.
12280,"So you're really doing this, huh?"
12281,"Oh yeah, picked a guy, 37135."
12282,Sounds nice.
12283,"'Fraid so. Brown hair, green eyes..."
12284,"No kiddin', hmm."
12286,"No, I-I figured you would've picked a blond guy."
12287,Really? Why?
12288,"I don't know, I just always pictured you ending up with one of those tall, smart blond guys, name like.... Hoyt."
12289,Hoyt?
12290,"It's a name, yeah. I saw you, you know, in this great house with a big pool."
12291,"Really, is he a swimmer?"
12292,He's got the body for it.
12293,I like that.  What?
12294,"You guys have one of those signs that says: 'We don't swim in your toilet, so don't pee in our pool.', you know."
12295,We do not have one of those signs.
12296,"Sure you do, it was a gift from me. Oh! And you have these three great kids."
12297,Two girls and a boy?
12299,"And, and, and they wear those little water wings, you know. And they're, they're running around on the deck. Then Hoyt wraps this big towel around all three of them."
12300,"Sure!  But hey, you know this way sounds good too."
12302,"Oh Monica.  Wow, this guy's an astronaut. That would've been cool,  for like a day. ."
12303,"I called the sperm bank today, they haven't sold a single unit of Tribianni. Nobody wants my product. I mean, I-I-I don't get it  Maybe if they met me in person."
12304,"Honey, you got a little thing on your..."
12305,Did I get it?
12309,"Hey.  Uh, Chan, can I uh, can I talk to you for a second?"
12310,Sure. What's up?
12311,"Just one uh, one additional relationship thought. Probably something your already familiar with, uh, women talk! "
